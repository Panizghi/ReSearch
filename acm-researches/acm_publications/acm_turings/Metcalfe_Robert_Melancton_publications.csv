Connectivity,"[{'name': 'Robert Melancton Metcalfe', 'dblp_profile': 'https://dblp.org/pid/69/829'}]",2023,"The most important new fact about the human condition is that we are now suddenly connected. When I say “suddenly” I refer to the Internet’s birthday, October 29, 1969 and how two thirds of the human race, five billion people, are already on the Internet, in only 50 years. Suddenly. The Arpanet started the Internet in 1969 by networking time-shared minicomputers serving dumb character terminals. Then in 1973 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) decided to put a personal computer on every desk. Ethernet was invented on May 22, 1973 to provide local connectivity among those PCs, one on every desk, if you can imagine that. The PARC Ethernet was formed by combining Jerrold coaxial vampire taps, Manchester on-off keying, and Alohanet randomized retransmissions. Then we wrapped it in internet protocols according to a layered reference model. Then we standardized it all: Ethernet, IP, TCP, TELNET, FTP, Mail, URL, HTML, HTTP. Ethernet evolved rapidly away from its Jerrold-Manchester-Alohanet prototype. Ethernet’s legacy is instead packets to the desktop, abundance of bandwidth, and standardization. Come hear all about it.

Ethervation: Innovation of and on the Ethernet platform,"[{'name': 'Bob Metcalfe', 'dblp_profile': 'https://dblp.org/pid/69/829'}]",2015,"Innovation sometimes advances in leaps and bounds when robust “platforms” appear.

The current context of computer science, Clark states, is shaped by past successes and chronic trouble spots. Mary Shaw, Carnegie Mellon University, examines challenges for software system designers. Shaw states that disintermediation-the direct connection of users and their software-has created new problems for software system designers. Robert Lucky, Bellcore, looks at IP dial tone, a new infrastructure for the Internet. Lucky states that data traffic will soon eclipse voice traffic, portending not just a revolution in technology but in the very basis of telecommunications economics.

Algorithms for accomplishing this delivery through a store-and-forward packet switching computer network include (1) transmission of separately addressed packets, (2) multidestination addressing, (3) hot potato forwarding, (4) spanning tree forwarding, and (5) source based forwarding. To this list of algorithms we add (6) reverse path forwarding, a broadcast routing method which exploits routing procedures and data structures already available for packet switching. Reverse path forwarding is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks. The algorithm is described as being practical because it is not optimal according to metrics developed for its analysis in this paper, and also because it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity than that required for the known alternatives.",e97deebb3a44515b93b2cfb1d22f13646b61c22e

We compare the merits and problems of linear, ring and several star configurations, and of active versus passive networks. The packet communication protocol is discussed and network efficiency is calculated as a function of the packet length, channel capacity and network propagation time. We describe the system performance of the present Fibernet experiment, which uses a 19-port transmissive star coupler, GaAIAs injection lasers and avalanche photodiodes, and incorporates bi-phase data encoding. Power distribution inhomogeneities, observed in the output of the transmissive star coupler's mixer rod, are explained geometric-optically.",7bb422b36cafe359a060a3a695dbb34da81829c5

Steady-state analysis of a slotted and controlled Aloha system with blocking,"[{'name': 'Bob Metcalfe', 'dblp_profile': 'https://dblp.org/pid/69/829'}]",1975,"We assume the reader is somewhat familiar with the ongoingdevelopment of Aloha techniques as described briefly in Abramson'sFJCC 7 0 paper and Roberts's SJCC72 paper. In short, an Alohasystem permits the (hopefully) occasional interference of datapacket transmissions in a multi-access channel and provides for theretransmission of lost packets after some randomly distributedinterval. The purposes behind permitting interference and providingrecovery are (1) reduced central communication control to improvereliability and (2) improved use of communication facilites underbursty loads as found in interactive computer communication. Alohatechniques are finding applicability in various communicationcontexts (e.g., satellites), but here the emphasis is onlarge populations of (potentially mobile) interactiveterminals.
Slotted. In a slotted Aloha system, all terminalsbegin their packet (re)transmissions at the ' tick of some globalclock. Slotting has been advocated by Roberts as a simple way toimprove the limiting thruput of an Aloha channel by a factor of 2.Global ticking can be implemented in a (hopefully positive) numberof ways and its feasibility is assumed in this paper. We rely onslotting to simplify our analysis, but suggest that the stabilityand control phenomena studied are characteristic of Aloha systemsin general.
Controlled. The notion of an optimal retransmission delaywas introduced by Roberts. We extend the notion to include dynamiccontrol of retransmission delay. A controlled Aloha systemhas the property that its terminals adjust their retransmissionbehavior as a function of perceived channel utilization. It will beshown that such adjustments are implementable in at least one wayand that they improve system performance under heavy loads.
Blocking and Thinking. When a user's terminal has a readypacket, it is assumed that no new packets can be generated. Theuser is said to be blocked. When a user is not blocked, heis said to be thinking. This assumption about user behaviordeparts from Abramson 's analysis and is thought to produce morerealistic solutions. Recall that Abramson (in FJCC70) modelledusers as unperturbable, realtime, Poisson sources of new packets.By adding blocking to an Aloha model, transmission delays feed back(as in real life) on the generation of transmission requests. Usersessions are said to be dilated by transmissions delays.
It is intended that think time account for (1) delays incentral system response, (2) return transmission delays, (3) realuser thinking time, and (4) type-in time. Block timeaccounts only for delays due to transmissions through themulti-access channel.
The following analysis rests on some (very) simplifyingassumptions about an Aloha system in equilibrium, in steady state.While having a large population of users tends to support oursteady-state arguments, the dynamics do indeed require moredetailed investigation.",32d7be7aa82746df8437ad5424eeb831fae3e37e

A primary objective of the ARPANET is to share preexisting programs and data. Many of the difficulties of using remotely generated programs and data are found to be simple format incompatibilities requiring data manipulations like character set conversion, header prefacing and stripping, packing and unpacking of repeated data, generating counters and flags, and field transposition. The data reconfiguration service (DRS) is an attempt to provide a convenient way of performing these data manipulations in order to mediate between superficially incompatible data streams connecting existing programs in the ARPANET. Desiring to match two incompatible input-output streams, an applications programmer specifies a data stream transformation (called a form) written in the data reconfiguration language (DRL). Associating the appropriate form name with the connection between his two programs, the programmer causes the DRS to follow his instructions on how the specified data streams are to be manipulated in the communication required to make the two programs cooperate over the ARPANET. Components of the DRS include the specification of its special-purpose data reconfiguration language, a form compiler to translate forms into fast-running transformation programs, an interpreter to perform high-speed data transformations at application program run time, and a standard set of ARPANET protocols for the routine handling of connections and form specifications between operating systems.",ac17e18497f42b8a5364fd37410ad128bc94e745

In this excerpt from ""Visions for the Future of the Fields,"" a panel discussion held at the 10th anniversary of the US Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, experts identify critical issues for various aspects of computing. In the accompanying sidebars, some of the same experts elaborate on points in the panel discussion in mini-essays: David Clark, CSTB chairman, looks at the changes needed, as computing science research comes of age. The current context of computer science, Clark states, is shaped by past successes and chronic trouble spots. Mary Shaw, Carnegie Mellon University, examines challenges for software system designers. Shaw states that disintermediation-the direct connection of users and their software-has created new problems for software system designers. Robert Lucky, Bellcore, looks at IP dial tone, a new infrastructure for the Internet. Lucky states that data traffic will soon eclipse voice traffic, portending not just a revolution in technology but in the very basis of telecommunications economics. Donald Greenberg, Cornell University, rounds out the essays with an outlook on computer graphics. Greenberg states that by 2025 we will have the technology to produce realistic real-time images at resolutions up to or beyond the limits of our visual perception.Finally, in an interview with William Wulf, president of the US National Academy of Engineering, Computer explores the roots of innovation and the broader societal aspects that will ultimately drive innovation in the near term.",e18e3cedbbbfbf371e5564b14b74506adda68b17

To this list of algorithms we add (6) reverse path forwarding, a broadcast routing method which exploits routing procedures and data structures already available for packet switching. Reverse path forwarding is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks. The algorithm is described as being practical because it is not optimal according to metrics developed for its analysis in this paper, and also because it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity than that required for the known alternatives.",e97deebb3a44515b93b2cfb1d22f13646b61c22e

Steady-state analysis of a slotted and controlled Aloha system with blocking,"[{'name': 'Bob Metcalfe', 'dblp_profile': 'https://dblp.org/pid/69/829'}]",1975,"We assume the reader is somewhat familiar with the ongoingdevelopment of Aloha techniques as described briefly in Abramson'sFJCC 7 0 paper and Roberts's SJCC72 paper. In short, an Alohasystem permits the (hopefully) occasional interference of datapacket transmissions in a multi-access channel and provides for theretransmission of lost packets after some randomly distributedinterval. The purposes behind permitting interference and providingrecovery are (1) reduced central communication control to improvereliability and (2) improved use of communication facilites underbursty loads as found in interactive computer communication. Alohatechniques are finding applicability in various communicationcontexts (e.g., satellites), but here the emphasis is onlarge populations of (potentially mobile) interactiveterminals.
Slotted. In a slotted Aloha system, all terminalsbegin their packet (re)transmissions at the ' tick of some globalclock. Slotting has been advocated by Roberts as a simple way toimprove the limiting thruput of an Aloha channel by a factor of 2.Global ticking can be implemented in a (hopefully positive) numberof ways and its feasibility is assumed in this paper. We rely onslotting to simplify our analysis, but suggest that the stabilityand control phenomena studied are characteristic of Aloha systemsin general.
Controlled. The notion of an optimal retransmission delaywas introduced by Roberts. We extend the notion to include dynamiccontrol of retransmission delay. A controlled Aloha systemhas the property that its terminals adjust their retransmissionbehavior as a function of perceived channel utilization. It will beshown that such adjustments are implementable in at least one wayand that they improve system performance under heavy loads.
Blocking and Thinking. When a user's terminal has a readypacket, it is assumed that no new packets can be generated. Theuser is said to be blocked. When a user is not blocked, heis said to be thinking. This assumption about user behaviordeparts from Abramson 's analysis and is thought to produce morerealistic solutions. Recall that Abramson (in FJCC70) modelledusers as unperturbable, realtime, Poisson sources of new packets.By adding blocking to an Aloha model, transmission delays feed back(as in real life) on the generation of transmission requests. Usersessions are said to be dilated by transmissions delays.
It is intended that think time account for (1) delays incentral system response, (2) return transmission delays, (3) realuser thinking time, and (4) type-in time. Block timeaccounts only for delays due to transmissions through themulti-access channel.
The following analysis rests on some (very) simplifyingassumptions about an Aloha system in equilibrium, in steady state.While having a large population of users tends to support oursteady-state arguments, the dynamics do indeed require moredetailed investigation.",32d7be7aa82746df8437ad5424eeb831fae3e37e

A primary objective of the ARPANET is to share preexisting programs and data. Many of the difficulties of using remotely generated programs and data are found to be simple format incompatibilities requiring data manipulations like character set conversion, header prefacing and stripping, packing and unpacking of repeated data, generating counters and flags, and field transposition. The data reconfiguration service (DRS) is an attempt to provide a convenient way of performing these data manipulations in order to mediate between superficially incompatible data streams connecting existing programs in the ARPANET. Desiring to match two incompatible input-output streams, an applications programmer specifies a data stream transformation (called a form) written in the data reconfiguration language (DRL). Associating the appropriate form name with the connection between his two programs, the programmer causes the DRS to follow his instructions on how the specified data streams are to be manipulated in the communication required to make the two programs cooperate over the ARPANET. Components of the DRS include the specification of its special-purpose data reconfiguration language, a form compiler to translate forms into fast-running transformation programs, an interpreter to perform high-speed data transformations at application program run time, and a standard set of ARPANET protocols for the routine handling of connections and form specifications between operating systems.",ac17e18497f42b8a5364fd37410ad128bc94e745
