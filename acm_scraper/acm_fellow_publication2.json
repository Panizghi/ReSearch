    "Full Abstract": "Queues are a widely used data structure in programming languages. They also provide an important synchronization mechanism in modeling distributed protocols. In this paper we extend the theory of queues with a length function that maps a queue to its size, resulting in a combined theory of queues and Presburger arithmetic. This extension provides a natural but tight coupling between the two theories, and hence the general Nelson-Oppen combination method for decision procedures is not applicable. We present a decision procedure for the quantifier-free theory and a quantifier elimination procedure for the first-order theory that can remove a block of existential quantifiers in one step."

We formulate the optimizations and analyses as instances of a general framework for data-flow analyses and transformations, and prove that the optimizations preserve the behavior of the compiled programs. This development is a part of a larger effort of certifying an optimizing compiler by proving semantic equivalence between source and compiled code."

    "Full Abstract": "One approach to Prof. Hoare's challenge is to view the development of verified software from the perspective of interactive theorem provers. This idea is not new and many medium-scale software systems have been developed and verified in this manner. Developments based on HOL, ACL2, or PVS have already been described and advocated and our position stands on the same line: most powerful (higher-order) theorem proving systems already contain a programming language, programs can be developed and the correctness of these programs can be specified and verified, they can then be compiled into traditional executable code. In this sense, we already have a small scale example of a verification aware programming language."

    "Full Abstract": "We extend the work of A. Ciaffaglione and P. di Gianantonio on the mechanical verification of algorithms for exact computation on real numbers, using infinite streams of digits implemented as a co-inductive type. Four aspects are studied. The first concerns the proof that digit streams correspond to axiomatised real numbers when they are already present in the proof system. The second re-visits the definition of an addition function, looking at techniques to let the proof search engine perform the effective construction of an algorithm that is correct by construction. The third concerns the definition of a function to compute affine formulas with positive rational coefficients. This is an example where we need to combine co-recursion and recursion. Finally, the fourth aspect concerns the definition of a function to compute series, with an application on the series that is used to compute Euler's number"

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.entcs.2008.05.018",
    "Full Abstract": "In Constructive Type Theory, recursive and corecursive definitions are subject to syntactic restrictions which guarantee termination for recursive functions and productivity for corecursive functions. However, many terminating and productive functions do not pass the syntactic tests. Bove proposed in her thesis an elegant reformulation of the method of accessibility predicates that widens the range of terminative recursive functions formalisable in Constructive Type Theory. In this paper, we pursue the same goal for productive corecursive functions. Notably, our method of formalisation of coinductive definitions of productive functions in Coq requires not only the use of ad-hoc predicates, but also a systematic algorithm that separates the inductive and coinductive parts of functions."

This widens the class of functions that can be modelled in type-theory based theorem proving tools to potentially nonterminating functions. This is only possible if we extend the logical framework by adding some axioms of classical logic.We claim that the extended framework makes it possible to reason about terminating or non-terminating computations and we show that extraction can also be extended to handle the new functions"

According to this approach, to construct a program meeting a given specification, the authors prove the existence of an object meeting the specified conditions. The proof is restricted to be sufficiently constructive, in the sense that, in establishing the existence of the desired output, the proof is forced to indicate a computational method for finding it. That method becomes the basis for a program that can be extracted from the proof. The exposition is based on the deductive-tableau system, a theorem-proving framework particularly suitable for program synthesis. The system includes a nonclausal resolution rule, facilities for reasoning about equality, and a well-founded induction rule."

    "Full Abstract": "The field of graphical man/machine interaction is customarily split into hardware and software areas. The former can be considered to have come of age: there are over twenty-five brands of off-the-shelf consoles with all the requisite input devices, and new techniques and improvements are constantly being developed. Many consoles are also provided with primitive supporting software which allow one to draw points, lines, arcs, etc., in a symbolic language of some sort. Less well understood and developed, however, is that aspect of display software concerned with representing and manipulating the problem model from which these primitive point/line/arc pictures are derived. The \"data structure\" is the machine representation of the often complex and hierarchical problem model. It must be judiciously derived from the model on the one hand and, on the other, lead readily to the reduced console display file of points, lines and arcs which cause the actual visual display. Furthermore, the data structure must be efficiently stored and processed (usually contradictory requirements)."

Each cache is connected to a bus used to communicate with the other caches and with main memory. For several of the proposed models of snoopy caching, we present new on-line algorithms which decide, for each cache, which blocks to retain and which to drop in order to minimize communication over the bus. We prove that, for any sequence of operations, our algorithms' communication costs are within a constant factor of the minimum required for that sequence; for some of our algorithms we prove that no on-line algorithm has this property with a smaller constant."

The basic approach is to transform the specifications repeatedly according to certain rules, until a satisfactory program is produced. The rules are guided by a number of strategic controls."

It is shown that equivalence, convergence, and other properties are decidable for schemes in this class. The class of synchronous schemes contains, as special cases, the known decidable classes of Ianov schemes, one-variable schemes with resets, and progressive schemes."

By the introduction of symmetrically dual sets of temporal operators, it is possible to discuss properties which hold either along one path or along all paths.

We present an exponential decision procedure for satisfiability in the language based on tableaux methods, and a complete deduction system. As associated temporal semantics is illustrated for both structured and graph representation of programs."

An attempt is made to formulate techniques of program modification, whereby a program that achieves one result can be transformed into a new program that uses the same principles to achieve a different goal. For example, a program that uses the binary search paradigm to divide two numbers may be modified to calculate the square-root of a number in a similar manner.Program debugging is considered as a special case of modification if a program computers wrong results, it must be modified to achieve the intended results The application of abstract program schemata to concrete problems is also viewed from the perspective of modification techniques.We, have embedded this approach in a running implementation; our methods are illustrated with several examples that have been performed by it."

It turns out that most known methods for proving properties of programs are very closely related to the computational induction method. We illustrate this point by showing how Floyd's inductive assertions method for proving properties of \"flowchart programs\" can be expressed in terms of computational induction on recursive programs."

They allow easy modification of designs for circuits, like controllers, that are described by patterns of events they must recognize and the responses they must make to those patterns. This paper discusses the compilation of such expressions into specifications for programmable logic arrays (PLAs) that will implement the required function. A regular expression is converted into a nondeterministic finite automaton, and then the automaton states are encoded as values on wires that are inputs and outputs of a PLA. The translation of regular expressions into nondeterministic automata by two different methods is discussed, along with the advantages of each method. A major part of the compilation problem is selection of good state codes for the nondeterministic automata; one successful strategy and its application to microcode compaction is explained in the paper."

The cover time is the first time when the particle has visited all the vertices in the graph, starting from a given vertex. Upper and lower bounds are presented that relate the expected cover time for a graph to the eigenvalues of the Markov chain that describes the above random walk. An interesting consequence is that regular expander graphs have expected cover time theta (n log n)."

Each cache is connected to a bus used to communicate with the other caches and with main memory. Each cache monitors the activity on the bus and in its own processor and decides which blocks of data to keep and which to discard. For several of the proposed architectures for snoopy caching systems, we present new on-line algorithms to be used by the caches to decide which blocks to retain and which to drop in order to minimize communication over the bus. We prove that, for any sequence of operations, our algorithms' communication costs are within a constant factor of the minimum required for that sequence; for some of our algorithms we prove that no on-line algorithm has this property with a smaller constant."

Both a random and a worst-case fault model are considered, and it is proved that in either scenario low-dimensional arrays are surprisingly fault tolerant. It is also shown how to route, sort, and perform systolic algorithms for problems such as matrix multiplication in optimal time on faulty arrays. In many cases, the running time is the same as if there were no faults in the array (up to constant factors). On the negative side, it is shown that any constant congestion embedding of an n*n fault-free array on an n*n array with Theta (n/sup 2/) random faults (or Theta (log n) worst-case faults) requires dilation Theta (log n). For 3-D arrays, knot theory is used to prove that the required dilation is Omega ( square root log n)."

Alternatively, the thread could spin until the lock is free, or spin for a while and then block. This may avoid context-switch overhead, but processor cycles may be wasted in unproductive spinning.

    "Full Abstract": "AN1 (formerly known as Autonet) is a local area network composed of crossbar switches interconnected by 100Mbit/second, full-duplex links. In this paper, we evaluate the performance impact of certain choices in the AN1 design. These include the use of FIFO input buffering in the crossbar switch, the deadlock-avoidance mechanism, cut-through routing, back-pressure for flow control, and multi-path routing. AN1's performance goals were to provide low latency and high bandwidth in a lightly loaded network. In this it is successful. Under heavy load, the most serious impediment to good performance is the use of FIFO input buffers. The deadlock-avoidance technique has an adverse effect on the performance of some topologies, but it seems to be the best alternative, given the goals and constraints of the AN1 design. Cut-through switching performs well relative to store-and-forward switching, even under heavy load. Back-pressure deals adequately with congestion in a lightly-loaded network; under moderate load, performance is acceptable when coupled with end-to-end flow control for bursts. Multi-path routing successfully exploits redundant paths between hosts to improve performance in the face of congestion."

We examine several simple questions of this type concerning the long-term behavior of a random walk on a finite graph. In our setup, each step of the random walk a âcontrollerâ can, with a certain small probability, fix the next step, thus introducing a bias. We analyze the extent to which the bias can affect the limit behavior of the walk. The controller is assumed to associate a real, nonnegative, âbenefitâ with each state, and to strive to maximize the long-term expected benefit. We derive tight bounds on the maximum of this objective function over all controller's strategies, and present polynomial time algorithms for computing the optimal controller strategy."

The on-line load balancing problem is to assign each task to an appropriate server in such a way that the maximum load on the servers is minimized. The authors derive matching upper and lower bounds for the competitive ratio of the on-line greedy algorithm for this problem, namely /sup (3n)2/3///sub 2/(1+o(1)), and derive a lower bound, Omega ( square root n), for any other deterministic or randomized on-line algorithm."

The authors use this model to study the fault-rate of paging algorithms, a quantity of interest to practitioners. They first draw on the theory of Markov decision processes to characterize the paging algorithm that achieves optimal fault-rate on any Markov chain. They address the problem of efficiently devising a paging strategy with low fault-rate for a given Markov chain. They show that a number of intuitively good approaches fail. Their main result is an efficient procedure that, on any Markov chain, will give a paging algorithm with fault-rate at most a constant times optimal. Their techniques also show that some algorithms that do poorly in practice fail in the Markov setting, despite known (good) performance guarantees when the requests are generated independently from a probability distribution."

Is there a spectrum of time-space trade-offs between these extremes?\" This question is answered in the affirmative for sparse graphs by presentation of an algorithm that is faster than the random walk by a factor essentially proportional to the size of its workspace.

The latter results are incomparable to Fredman's, since the presence of DELETE instructions was crucial for his proof technique. We will present our results in detail in the next few sections. Here we will only mention three main conclusions. Firstly, circular query is shown to be intrinsically hard in the sense that, for some static database with n records, there is a space-time tradeoff TS > n"

The new Interdata target machine is patterned after the /360 (including all five instruction formats), but also has instructions particularly designed for intelligent terminal programming. These include instructions for character string manipulation, code conversion, list processing, coordinate manipulation, and virtual addressing. A powerful multiplexor channel, which allows the programmer to \"overlap\" I/O to several devices with a CPU program, has also been microprogrammed."

A number of approaches (definition of sophisticated target machines, microcode assemblers, and higher level microprogramming languages) have been proposed. The issues involved in choosing support tools include the range of proposed applications, hardware parallelism (horizental or minimally encoded control vs. vertically encoded control) and constraints on performance. After reviewing some of these tradeoffs, design considerations for higher level microprogramming languages are considered. One of the most important design decisions is fixing the level of the language, defined on a continuum from symbolic assemblers, through general purpose programming languages such as PL/I. A tailored language concept is defined and illustrated, using as an example a microprogramming language for a horizontally encoded microprogrammable computer currently under development."

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1006/inco.1994.1060",
    "Full Abstract": "We extend the specification language of temporal logic, the corresponding verification framework, and the underlying computational model to deal with real-;time properties of reactive systems. The abstract notion of timed transition systems generalizes traditional transition systems conservatively: qualitative fairness requirements are replaced (and superseded) by quantitative lower-bound and upper-bound timing constraints on transitions. This framework can model real-time systems that communicate either through shared variables or by message passing and real-time issues such as timeouts, process priorities (interrupts), and process scheduling. We exhibit two styles for the specification of real-time systems. While the first approach uses time-bounded versions of the temporal operators, the second approach allows explicit references to time through a special clock variable. Corresponding to the two styles of specification, we present and compare two different proof methodologies for the verification of timing requirements that are expressed in these styles. For the bounded-operator style, we provide a set of proof rules for establishing bounded-invariance and bounded-responce properties of timed transition systems. This approach generalizes the standard temporal proof rules for verifying invariance and response properties conservatively. For the explicit-clock style, we exploit the observation that every time-bounded property is a safety property and use the standard temporal proof rules for establishing safety properties."

    "Full Abstract": "One of the reasons for developing high level languages has been the desire for program portability from one type of machine to another. To achieve the high degree of machine independence necessary for program portability, these languages have included general features such as arithmetic expressions, arrays, and subroutine calls which can be implemented on many machines. Facilities such as the interrupt mechanism, program status word, and device dependent input/output which are available to the assembly language programmer are hidden from the high level programmer. Unfortunately, the code generated by compilers for these high level languages is often very inefficient compared to that produced by experienced assembly language programmers. However, the added expressiveness and the ability to leave details to the compiler usually offset the inefficiency of generated code, particularly for non-systems applications. For such applications, the facilities which the high level programmer cannot use are not needed anyway."

The necessity of meeting a \"critical intelligence threshold\" criterion for the satellite is stressed, and some difficult problems and potential solutions in the division of labor between mainframe and satellite are briefly examined.

    "Full Abstract": "The STRUCT system utilizes the flexibility of a powerful graphics display system to provide a set of tools for program analysis. These tools allow the analysis of the static prograin structure and the dynamic execution behavior. of programs within the entire operating system/user program environment of the Brown University Graphics System (BUGS). Information is collected and presented in a manner which fully exploits two aspects of this environment. First, the operating system has been developed in a well-structured hierarcal manner following principles laid down by other researchers (2), (3). Second the programs under analysis have been written in a structured programming language following coding conventions which make available, at the source code level, valuable program control information. A new set of pictorial constructs is introduced for presenting a. program structure (static or dynamic) for inspection. These constructs combine the best features of an indented structured source code listing and the box odented nature of traditional flow charts. The graphical tools available are USed to provide for swift changes in. the desired level of detail displayed within a program structure, for traveling linearly through a program structure, for traveling through a complex program structure (following subroutine or system calls), for concurrently viewing multiple related program structures, and for presenting dynamic program behavior data using three-dimensional projections, The volume of a three-dimensional box representing a program block is proportional to the block's resource utilization. The scope of this paper is limited to a description of the STRUCT system. This system is currently being used to predict and analyze the performance advantages available through the migration of function (program modules) between levels of software and between software and firmware within BUGS. The results of this research on migration will be included in a doctoral dissertation currently being written."

The division of labor in the application is determined by a network flow assignment algorithm.

In particular, host availability is an important factor in determining the task distribution. As host availability decreased, procedures miqrate from the host to the satellite."

    "Full Abstract": "GPGS is a subroutine package offering powerful and versatile support for passive and interactive vector graphics, for time-sharing, batch, and stand-alone minicomputer systems. The package is computer, language, and operating system, as well as display device independent. Its key purpose is to allow for transportabiliit of programs and programmers by providing easy to learn, high level features. The applications programmer writes his program once and then executes it on any supported graphics equipment without recompiling or relinking it. Device-independence was implemented by dividing GPGS into a device-independent part invoked by the applications programmer, and internal, \"device drivers\", one per display device. Like the GSPC \"Core System\" whose design it influenced, GPGS is a general purpose package. It has a subset of graphics facilities to handle output of line and character primitives with attributes such as line style and character size, and input from interaction tools such as lightpens, keyboards, valuators, and function keys. It also supports 2D and 3D viewin transformationss for clipping and window to viewport mapping, and coordinate transformations.Unlike the GSPC Core System, GPGS also includes a set of basic features for modelling objects which allows definition of device independent masters called seudo picture segment. These are distinguished from normal, device (DPU) dependent pictur segments into which primitives and their attribute-value settings are ordinarily compiled. These masters may be instanced subject to affine transformations (translate, rotate, and scale) to create a typical master-instance hierarchy. The hierarchy may be stored in a disk based library or compiled into a normal picture segment for output to a display device.The images of objects stored in device dependent picture segments may be transformed on the display surface by v port (image) transformations. These typically allow use of hardware transformation capabilities for dragging or tumbling object images.Host/satellite graphics is accommodated by having the device independent part of GPGS in the host and splitting the device drivers across host and satellite. At the source code level it therefore makes no difference on which.configuration a program will be executed.Among the existing implementations are versions written in assembler for the IB 360/370 and the PDP 11, in both stand-alone and satellite mode, and under a variety of operating systems. They support plotters, storage tubes, and high performance refresh displays. FORTRAN based implementations exist for the Univac 1108, the PDP 10, and a Harris minicomputer."

It shows the operation of the system at various levels of detail, down to the level of the devices' internal registers, buffers, control lines, and buses. This paper describes the design, implementation, and use of MIDAS. It discusses its effectiveness as a tool for teaching the complex, asynchronous interaction between devices of a computer system (known as \"handshaking\").

These algorithms achieve competitive ratios approachinge/(eÅº1) Åº 1.58 against an oblivious adversary. These ratios are optimal and are a surprising improvement over the best possible ratio in the deterministic case, which is 2. We also consider the situation when the request sequences for these problems are generated according to an unknown probability distribution. In this case we show that deterministic algorithms that adapt to the observed request statistics also have competitive factors approachinge/(eÅº1). Finally, we obtain randomized algorithms for the 2-server problem on a class of isosceles triangles. These algorithms are optimal against an oblivious adversary and have competitive ratios that approache/(eÅº1). This compares with the ratio of 3/2 that can be achieved on an equilateral triangle."

Furthermore, lower bounds for the time complexity of a class of deterministic algorithms for the dictionary problem are proved. This class encompasses realistic hashing-based schemes that use linear space. Such algorithms have amortized worst-case time complexity $\\Omega(\\log n)$ for a sequence of $n$ insertions and lookups; if the worst-case lookup time is restricted to $k$, then the lower bound becomes $\\Omega(k\\cdot n^{1/k})$."

This article presents the design, implementation, and performance of a file system that integrates application-controlled caching, prefetching, and disk scheduling. We use a two-level cache management strategy.

In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for the modular description and verification of parameterized fair transition systems. The framework allows us to apply existing global verification methods, such as verification rules and diagrams, in a modular setting. Transition systems and transition modules can be described by recursive module expressions, allowing the description of hierarchical systems of unbounded depth. Apart from the usual parallel composition, hiding and renaming operations, our module description language provides constructs to augment and restrict the module interface, capablilities that are essential for recursive descriptions. We present proof rules for property inheritance between modules. Finally, module abstraction and induction allow the verification of recursively defined systems. Our approach is illustrated with a recursively defined arbiter for which we verify mutual exclusion and eventual access."

This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, is constructed by separately determining an optimal surface between each pair of consecutive contours. Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed toroidal graph. A new fast algorithm for finding such cycles is utilized. Also developed is a closed-form expression, in terms of the number of contour points, for an upper bound on the number of operations required to execute the algorithm.

This preprocessing is based on generating a âbinary space partitioningâ tree whose in order traversal of visibility priority at run-time will produce a linear order, dependent upon the viewing position, on (parts of) the polygons, which can then be used to easily solve the hidden surface problem. In the application where the entire environment is static with only the viewing-position changing, as is common in simulation, the results presented will be sufficient to solve completely the hidden surface problem."

    "Full Abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of developing a family of locking protocols which employ both SHARED and EXCLUSIVE locks and which ensure the consistency of database systems that are accessed concurrently by a number of asynchronously running transactions. The protocols in the family are not two-phase. They are applicable to database systems which are hierarchically organized as well as database systems which are modeled by directed acyclic graphs. A comparison with other previously published protocols is also presented."

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582318.582329",
    "Full Abstract": "The problem of removing deadlocks from concurrent database systems using the two-phase locking protocol is considered. In particular, for systems which use no a priori information about transaction behavior in order to avoid deadlocks, it has generally been assumed necessary to totally remove and restart some transaction involved in a deadlock in order to relieve the situation. In this paper, a new approach to deadlock removal in such systems based on partial rollbacks is introduced. This approach does not in general require the total removal of a transaction to eliminate a deadlock. The task of optimizing deadlock removal using this method is discussed for systems allowing both exclusive and shared locking. A method is given for implementing this approach with no more storage overhead than that required for total removal and restart."

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1286831.1286843",
    "Full Abstract": "In database systems which allow concurrent processing, it is necessary to control the interaction among the concurrent transactions in order to prevent them from destroying the consistency of the database. The most common mechanism proposed to achieve this involves the use of locking and unlocking instrucions to provide controlled access to units of shared data. These instructions are embedded in the transactions according to rules which are called locking protocols. A correct locking protocol assures that the consistency of the database is preserved and that no deadlocks occur to prevent termination of the transactions. In this paper, a theory is developed of how a priori syntactic information about the behavior of the transactions in a system can be used to construct correct protocols. The relationship between the problems of assuring correctness and deadlock-freedom is explored in a unified model which applies to systems which allow only exclusive locks as well as to systems which allow both exclusive and shared access nodes."

When these personal computers have high-resolution bit-mapped graphics displays, fast processors, and virtual memory, and are linked in networks, they combine the best of dedicated computing (e.g., immediate response) with the best of time-sharing (e.g., resource-sharing of programs, data and peripherals). Personal computers so configured are typically called workstations. Such workstations have been introduced in the last few years primarily for professionals in productivity-sensitive areas like engineering design and office automation, but recent price/performance improvement has made it possible to consider them for use in education as well."

However, little is known about patterns of shared document access, particularly from diverse client populations. The principal goal of this paper is to examine the sharing of Web documents from an organizational point of view. An organizational analysis of sharing is important, because caching is often performed on an organizational basis; i.e., proxies are typically placed in front of large and small companies, universities, departments, and so on. Unfortunately, simultaneous multi-organizational traces do not currently exist and are difficult to obtain in practice."

This paper uses both trace-based analysis and analytic modelling to show the potential advantages and drawbacks of inter-proxy cooperation. With our traces, we evaluate quantitatively the performance-improvement potential of cooperation between 200 small-organization proxies within a university environment, and between two large-organization proxies handling 23,000 and 60,000 clients, respectively. With our model, we extend beyond these populations to project cooperative caching behavior in regions with millions of clients. Overall, we demonstrate that cooperative caching has performance benefits only within limited population bounds. We also use our model to examine the implications of future trends in Web-access behavior and traffic."

We use this model to study the fault-rate of paging algorithms. We first draw on the theory of Markov decision processes to characterize the paging algorithm that achieves optimal fault-rate on any Markov chain. Next, we address the problem of devising a paging strategy with low fault-rate for a given Markov chain. We show that a number of intuitive approaches fail. Our main result is a polynomial-time procedure that, on any Markov chain, will give a paging algorithm with fault-rate at most a constant times optimal. Our techniques show also that some algorithms that do poorly in practice fail in the Markov setting, despite known (good) performance guarantees when the requests are generated independently from a probability distribution."

The key to this unification lies in capturing the correlations between each of these components in terms of proximity in latent semantic space. Given such a combined model, the correct answer to a search query is well defined, and thus it becomes possible to evaluate web search algorithms rigorously. We present a new web search algorithm, based on spectral techniques, and prove that it is guaranteed to produce an approximately correct answer in our model. The algorithm assumes no knowledge of the model, and is well-defined regardless of the accuracy of the model."

    "Full Abstract": "We present a model for web search that captures in a unified manner three critical components of the problem: how the link structure of the web is generated, how the contentof a web document is generated, and how a human searcher generates a query. The key to this unification lies in capturing the correlations between these components in terms of proximity in a shared latent semantic space. Given such a combined model, the correct answer to a search query is well defined, and thus it becomes possible to evaluate web search algorithms rigorously. We present a new web search algorithm, based on spectral techniques, and prove that it is guaranteed to produce an approximately correct answer in our model. The algorithm assumes no knowledge of the model, and is well-defined regardless of the model's accuracy."

Our approach is generic: we are not constructing a user interface for a particular proof system, rather we have developed techniques and tools that have been applied to several proof systems. We first propose and motivate a distributed architecture, where the proof system and the interface are two separate processes communicating through a protocol. Then we describe three high-level features:proof-by-pointing,script management, andtextual explanation. Altogether, they take advantage of the underlying architecture and yield a more user-friendly proof environment."

Choosing a particular representation for a given concept has a strong influence on proof structure. We propose a method to make the change from one representation to another easier, by systematically translating proofs from one context to another. Weshow how this method works by using it on natural numbers, for which a unary representation (based on Peano axioms) and a binary representation are available. This method leads to an automatic translation tool that we have implemented in Coq and successfully applied to several arithmetical theorems."

    "Full Abstract": "We describe the operational and denotational semantics of a small imperative language in type theory with inductive and recursive definitions. The operational semantics is given by natural inference rules, implemented as an inductive relation. The realization of the denotational semantics is more delicate: The nature of the language imposes a few difficulties on us. First, the language is Turing-complete, and therefore the interpretation function we consider is necessarily partial. Second, the language contains strict sequential operators, and therefore the function necessarily exhibits nested recursion. Our solution combines and extends recent work by the authors and others on the treatment of general recursive functions and partial and nested recursive functions. The first new result is a technique to encode the approach of Bove and Capretta for partial and nested recursive functions in type theories that do not provide simultaneous induction-recursion. A second result is a clear understanding of the characterization of the definition domain for general recursive functions, a key aspect in the approach by iteration of Balaa and Bertot. In this respect, the work on operational semantics is a meaningful example, but the applicability of the technique should extend to other circumstances where complex recursive functions need to be described formally."

This methodology is complete relative to the underlying first-order reasoning. However, the proofs can be difficult to construct and understand, particularly as the complexity of the system increases.We have developed diagram-based formalisms for the verification of general temporal properties of reactive, real-time and hybrid systems. A diagram is a visual abstraction of the system to be verified; it represents the aspects of the system relevant to the property to be proved. The diagram represents a schematic overview of a deductive proof, and therefore it is more intuitive and easier to construct and understand.These methods combine deductive and algorithmic verification, and are being extended to include modularity, abstraction and refinement to facilitate the verification of larger, more complex systems."

Logical formulas are used to represent infinite sets of states in an abstraction of this graph, which is repeatedly refined in the search for a counterexample computation, ruling out large portions of the graph before they are expanded to the state-level. This can lead to large savings, even in the case of finite-state systems. Only local conditions need to be checked at each step, and previously proven properties can be used to further constrain the search. Although the resulting method is not always automatic, it provides a flexible, general and complete framework that can integrate a diverse number of other verification tools."

Our technique uses the theory of ideals over polynomial rings to reduce the non-linear invariant generation problem to a numerical constraint solving problem. So far, the literature on invariant generation has been focussed on the construction of linear invariants for linear programs. Consequently, there has been little progress toward non-linear invariant generation. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique that encodes the conditions for a given template assertion being an invariant into a set of constraints, such that all the solutions to these constraints correspond to non-linear (algebraic) loop invariants of the program. We discuss some trade-offs between the completeness of the technique and the tractability of the constraint-solving problem generated. The application of the technique is demonstrated on a few examples."

The method performs forward propagation in an abstract domain consisting of arbitrary polyhedra of a predefined fixed shape. The basic operations on the domain like abstraction, intersection, join and inclusion tests are all posed as linear optimization queries, which can be solved efficiently by existing LP solvers. The number and dimensionality of the LP queries are polynomial in the program dimensionality, size and the number of target invariants. The method generalizes similar analyses in the interval, octagon, and octahedra domains, without resorting to polyhedral manipulations. We demonstrate the performance of our method on some benchmark programs."

Such monitoring is useful not only for testing, but also under actual deployment. The specification language is simple and expressive; it can describe both correctness/failure assertions along with interesting statistical measures that are useful for system profiling and coverage analysis. The algorithm for online monitoring of queries in this language follows a partial evaluation strategy: it incrementally constructs output streams from input streams, while maintaining a store of partially evaluated expressions for forward references. We identify a class of specifications, characterized syntactically, for which the algorithmÃ½s memory requirement is independent of the length of the input streams. Being able to bound memory requirements is especially important in online monitoring of large input streams. We extend the concepts used in the online algorithm to construct an efficient offline monitoring algorithm for large traces. We have implemented our algorithm and applied it to two industrial systems, the PCI bus protocol and a memory controller. The results demonstrate that our algorithms are practical and that our specification language is sufficiently expressive to handle specifications of interest to industry."

The arguments used in the various derivations are later used to specify which of the components are critical depending on the relative sizes of the chip and the number of variables of the function to be computed. The general lower bound is powerful enough that many of the previously proved lower bounds (which could account only for some of the functional requirements) are obtained as explicit special cases of the new result."

So far the protocol has been proved secure even under channel noise and detector faults of the receiver, but is vulnerable if the photon source used is imperfect. In this paper we propose and give a concrete design for a new concept, \"self-checking source\", which requires the manufacturer of the photon source to provide certain tests; these tests are designed such that, if passed, the source is guaranteed to be adequate for the security of the quantum key distribution protocol, even though the testing devices may not be built to the original specification.

    "Full Abstract": "Would physical laws permit the construction of computing machines that are capable of solving some problems much faster than the standard computational model? Recent evidence suggests that this might be the case in the quantum world. But the question is of great interest even in the realm of classical physics. In this article, we observe that there is fundamental tension between the Extended Church--Turing Thesis and the existence of numerous seemingly intractable computational problems arising from classical physics. Efforts to resolve this incompatibility could both advance our knowledge of the theory of computation, as well as serve the needs of scientific computing."

Several models are formulated in which the security of protocols can be discussed precisely. Algorithms and characterizations that can be used to determine protocol security in these models are given."

    "Full Abstract": "The quantum query complexity of searching for local optima has been a subject of much interest in the recent literature. For the d-dimensional grid graphs, the complexity has been determined asymptotically for all fixed d \\geqslant 5, but the lower dimensional cases present special difficulties, and considerable gaps exist in our knowledge. In the present paper we present near-optimal lower bounds, showing that the quantum query complexity for the 2-dimensional grid [n]^2 is \\Omega \\left( {n^{1/2 - \\delta } } \\right), and that for the 3-dimensional grid [n]^3 is \\Omega (n^{1- \\delta } ), for any fixed \\delta \\ge 0. A general lower bound approach for this problem, initiated by Aaronson [1](based on Ambainis' adversary method [3] for quantum lower bounds), uses random walks with low collision probabilities. This approach encounters obstacles in deriving tight lower bounds in low dimensions due to the lack of degrees of freedom in such spaces. We solve this problem by the novel construction and analysis of random walks with non-uniform step lengths. The proof employs in a nontrivial way sophisticated results of Sarkozy and Szemeredi [14], Bose and Chowla [5], and Halasz [9] from combinatorial number theory, as well as less familiar probability tools like Esseen's Inequality."

An open problem (or, natural query) raised in the literature is: are there any other essential security properties, other than the well-known deniability property, that could be lost by universal composable zero-knowledge in the common reference string model, in comparison with UC security in the plain model? In this work, we answer this open question (or, natural query), by showing that UCZK protocols in the CRS model could lose concurrent general composability (CGC) and proof of knowledge (POK) properties that are very important and essential security implications of UCZK in the plain model. This is demonstrated by concrete attacks."

    "Full Abstract": "We present an interactive modeling and animation system that facilitates the integration of a variety of simulation and animation paradigms. This system permits the modeling of diverse objects that change in shape, appearance, and behaviour over time. Our system thus extends modeling tools to include animation controls. Changes can be effected by various methods of control, including scripted, gestural, and behavioral specification. The system is an extensible testbed that supports research in the interaction of disparate control methods embodied in controller objects. This paper discusses some of the issues involved in modeling such interactions and the mechanisms implemented to provide solutions to some of these issues.The system's object-oriented architecture uses delegation hierarchies to let objects change all of their attributes dynamically. Objects include displayable objects, controllers, cameras, lights, renderers, and user interfaces. Techniques used to obtain interactive performance include the use of data-dependency networks, lazy evaluation, and extensive caching to exploit inter- and intra-frame coherency."

These shadow widgets provide two advances over previous techniques. First, they provide high correlation between their own geometric feedback and their effects on the objects they control. Second, unlike some other 3D widgets, they do not obscure the objects they control."

His first class was not of graduate students or post-docs, but was a group of forward thinking high school teachers and their best students. It was this experience that inspired van Dam to pursue a career in academia. For the past 30 years he has taught at Brown University where he co-founded the department of computer science and for 10 years served as its first chairman. The past five years have seen exceptionally strong demand for integration of computers into K-12 curricula driven both by the media hype surrounding computer technology and networks and the increasing pressure on educational institutions to improve scope and quality of education in a publicly demonstrable fashion. These forces have combined to produce a time of great potential for education but also one of great danger. Educators and administrators must consider how can this technology be used to promote rigorous and useful learning rather merely adding glitz to traditional types of assignments. Educators and administrators must also be aware that although computers can bring education to a more diverse and expanding audience, the same technology can serve to divide societies into groups of haves and have nots. van Dam analyzes several means of approaching these and other issues, drawing on current research findings and using real life examples from his experience as a researcher educator, and Director of the Graphics and Visualization Center."

    "Full Abstract": "We describe mechanisms for auctions that are simultaneously truthful (alternately known as strategy-proof or incentive compatible) and guarantee high \"net\" profit. We make use of appropriate variants of competitive analysis of algorithms in designing and analyzing our mechanisms. Thus, we do not require any probabilistic assumptions on bids.We present two new concepts regarding auctions, that of a cancellable auction and that of a generalized auction. We use cancellable auctions in the design of generalized auctions, but they are of independent interest as well. Cancellable auctions have the property that if the revenue collected does not meet certain predetermined criteria, then the auction can be cancelled and the resulting auction is still truthful. The trivial approach (run a truthful auction and cancel if needed) yields an auction that is not necessarily truthfu.Generalized auctions can be used to model many problems previously considered in the literature, as well as numerous new problems. In particular, we give the first truthful profit-maximizing auctions for problems such as conditional financing and multicast."

We assume that each bidder's utility value for the item is private to them and we focus on truthful mechanisms, ones were the bidders' optimal strategy is to bid their true utility. The profit of the auctioneer is the difference between the total payments from buyers and total to the sellers. We aim to maximize this profit. We extend the competitive analysis framework of basic auctions [9] and give an upper bound on the profit of any truthful double auction. We then reduce the competitive double auction problem to basic auctions by showing that any competitive basic auction can be converted into a competitive double auction with a competitive ratio of twice that of the basic auction. In addition, we show that better competitive ratios can be obtained by directly adapting basic auction techniques to the double auction problem. This result provides insight into the design of profit maximizing mechanisms in general."

    "Full Abstract": "The emergence of the Internet as one of the most important arenas for resource sharing between parties with diverse and selfish interests has led to a number of fascinating and new algorithmic problems. In these problems, one must solicit the inputs to each computation from participants (or agents) whose goal is to manipulate the computation to their own advantage. Until fairly recently, failure models in computer science have not dealt the notion of selfish participants who \"play by the rules\" only when it fits them. To deal with this, algorithms must be designed so as to provide motivation to the participants to \"play along\". Recent work in this area, has drawn on ideas from game theory and microeconomics, and specifically from the field of mechanism design. The goal is to design protocols so that rational agents will be motivated to adhere to the protocol. A specific focus has been on truthful mechanisms in which selfish agents are motivated to reveal their true inputs.In the first part of the talk, we survey recent work in the area of algorithm mechanism design. In the second part of the talk, we focus on mechanism design specifically geared at maximizing the profit of the mechanism designer. In particular, we consider a class of dynamic pricing problems motivated by the same computational and economic trends. We describe a class of generalized auction problems as well as a competitive framework that can be used to evaluate solutions to these problems. We present a number of results on the design of profit-maximizing truthful generalized auctions. This is joint work with Amos Fiat, Andrew Goldberg and Jason Hartline."

As common in the field of mechanism design, we assume that the agents are selfish and will act in such a way as to maximize their profit, which in particular may include misrepresenting their true incurred cost. Our first contribution is a new and natural definition of the frugality ratio of a mechanism, measuring the amount by which a mechanism \"overpays\", and extending previous definitions to all monopoly-free set systems. After reexamining several known results in light of this new definition, we proceed to study in detail shortest path auctions and \"r-out-of-k sets\" auctions. We show that when individual set systems (e.g., graphs) are considered instead of worst cases over all instances, these problems exhibit a rich structure, and the performance of mechanisms may be vastly different. In particular, we show that the wellknown VCG mechanism may be far from optimal in these settings, and we propose and analyze a mechanism that is always within a constant factor of optimal."

Advertisers are able to buy space on the webpages produced by popular search engines and place advertisements to promote their products alongside the regular algorithmic search results. The allocation of these advertising slots and their pricing is done via auctions. Since the introduction of this concept in 1998, sponsored search has evolved into a major source of revenue for internet giants such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN and others. Its success can be attributed partly to its effectiveness as a form of highly targeted advertising, and partly to the appealing framework that allows even small-scale advertisers to use it easily and effectively while only paying when their ad is clicked upon."

This problem is equivalent to the problem of coming up with an optimal strategy for blowing up indistinguishable balloons with known capacities in order to maximize the amount of contained air. We show that the algorithm which simply inflates all balloons to a fixed volume is close to optimal in this setting."

This brings together two agendas in algorithmic mechanism design, frugality in procurement mechanisms (e.g., for paths and spanning trees) and profit maximization in auctions (e.g., for digital goods). In the standard approach to frugality in procurement, a buyer attempts to purchase a set of elements that satisfy a feasibility requirement as cheaply as possible. For profit maximization in auctions, a seller wishes to sell some number of goods for as much as possible. We unify these objectives by endowing the buyer with a decreasing marginal benefit per feasible set purchased and then considering the problem of designing a mechanism to buy a number of sets which maximize the buyer's profit, i.e., the difference between their benefit for the sets and the cost of procurement. For the case where the feasible sets are bases of a matroid, we follow the approach of reducing the mechanism design optimization problem to a mechanism design decision problem. We give a"

    "Full Abstract": "The data migration problem is the problem of computing a plan for moving data objects stored on devices in a network from one configuration to another. Load balancing or changing usage patterns might necessitate such a rearrangement of data. In this paper, we consider the case where the objects are fixed-size and the network is complete. Our results are both theoretical and empirical. Our main theoretical results are (1) a polynomial time algorithm for finding a near-optimal migration plan in the presence of space constraints when a certain number of additional nodes is available as temporary storage, and (2) a 3/2-approximation algorithm for the case where data must be migrated directly to its destination. We also run extensive experiments on several algorithms for various data migration problems and show that empirically, many algorithms perform better in practice than their theoretical bounds suggest. We conclude that many of the algorithms we present are both practical and effective for data migration."

    "Full Abstract": "In a unit-demand multi-unit multi-item auction, an auctioneer is selling a collection of different items to a set of agents each interested in buying at most unit. Each agent has a different private value for each of the items. We consider the problem of designing a truthful auction that maximizes the auctioneer's profit in this setting. Previously, there has been progress on this problem in the setting in which each value is drawn from a known prior distribution. Specifically, it has been shown how to design auctions tailored to these priors that achieve a constant factor approximation ratio [2, 5]. In this paper, we present a prior-independent auction for this setting. This auction is guaranteed to achieve a constant fraction of the optimal expected profit for a large class of, so called, \"regular\" distributions, without specific knowledge of the distributions."

    "Full Abstract": "In many real-world auctions, a bidder does not know her exact value for an item, but can perform a costly deliberation to reduce her uncertainty. Relatively little is known about such deliberative environments, which are fundamentally different from classical auction environments. In this paper, we propose a new approach that allows us to leverage classical revenue-maximization results in deliberative environments. In particular, we use Myerson (1981) to construct the first nontrivial (i.e., dependent on deliberation costs) upper bound on revenue in deliberative auctions. This bound allows us to apply existing results in the classical environment to a deliberative environment. In addition, we show that in many deliberative environments the only optimal dominant-strategy mechanisms take the form of sequential posted-price auctions."

If designers could receive immediate feedback on their designs, they could explore a vast space of variations, and select only the most promising games for playtesting. Such automated design feedback has been difficult to achieve, as there is no mathematical formulation of game balance that unifies many of its forms. We argue for a formulation in which carefully restricted agents are played against standard agents. We develop this"

The guardedness condition is imposed on definitions of corecursive functions in Coq, AGDA, and other higher-order proof assistants. In this paper, we concentrate in particular on those non-guarded equations where recursive calls appear under functions. We use a correspondence between streams and functions over natural numbers to show that some classes of non-guarded definitions can be modelled through the encoding as structural recursive functions. In practice, this work extends the class of stream values that can be defined in a constructive type theory-based theorem prover with inductive and coinductive types, structural recursion and guarded corecursion."

It consists in repeating a sequence of edge flippings from an initial triangulation until the Delaunay property is achieved. To describe triangulations, we rely on a combinatorial hypermap specification framework we have been developing for years. We embed hypermaps in the plane by attaching coordinates to elements in a consistent way. We then describe what are legal and illegal Delaunay edges and a flipping operation which we show preserves hypermap, triangulation, and embedding invariants. To prove the termination of the algorithm, we use a generic approach expressing that any non-cyclic relation is well-founded when working on a finite set."

As an illustration, we show how to describe good approximations of the logarithm function and we compute -- to a precision of a million decimals inside the proof system, with a guarantee that all digits up to the millionth decimal are correct. All these experiments are performed with the Coq system, but most of the steps should apply to any interactive theorem prover."

This fragment allows a constrained use of universal quantification, so that one quantifier alternation is allowed, with some syntactic restrictions. It allows expressing, for example, that an assertion holds for all elements in a given index range, that two arrays are equal in a given range, or that an array is sorted. We demonstrate its expressiveness through applications to verification of sorting algorithms and parameterized systems. We also prove that satisfiability is undecidable for several natural extensions to the fragment. Finally, we describe our implementation in the"

    "Full Abstract": "Term algebras can model recursive data structures which are widely used in programming languages. To verify programs we must be able to reason about these structures. However, as programming languages often involve multiple data domains, in program verification decision procedures for a single theory are usually not applicable. An important class of mixed constraints consists of combinations of data structures with integer constraints on the size of data structures. Such constraints can express memory safety properties such as absence of memory overflow and out-of-bound array access, which are crucial for program correctness. In this paper we extend the theory of term algebras with the length function which maps a term to its size, resulting in a combined theory of term algebras and Presburger arithmetic. This arithmetic extension provides a natural but tight coupling between the two theories, and hence the general purpose combination methods like Nelson-Op-pen combination are not applicable. We present decision procedures for quantifier-free theories in structures with an infinite constant domain and with a finite constant domain. We also present a quantifier elimination procedure for the extended first-order theory that can remove a block of existential quantifiers in one step."

Deadlock avoidance in distributed systems is a hard problem and general solutions are considered impractical due to the high communication overhead. In previous work, however, we showed that practical solutions exist when all possible sequences of resource requests are known a priori in the form of call graphs; in this case protocols can be constructed that perform safe resource allocation based on local data only, that is, no communication between components is required. While avoiding deadlock, those protocols, however, did not avoid starvation: they guaranteed that some process could always make progress, but did not guarantee that every individual process would always eventually terminate.In this paper we present a resource allocation mechanism that avoids deadlock and guarantees absence of starvation, without undue loss of concurrency. The only assumption we make is that the local scheduler is fair. We prove the correctness of the algorithm and show how it can be implemented efficiently."

However, the self-balancing ability comes at a price; balanced trees are more complex than their unbalanced counterparts both in terms of data structure themselves and related manipulation operations. In this paper we present a framework to model balanced trees in decidable first-order theories of term algebras with Presburger arithmetic. In this framework, a theory of term algebras (i.e., a theory of finite trees) is extended with Presburger arithmetic and with certain connecting functions that map terms (trees) to integers. Our framework is flexible in the sense that we can obtain a variety of decidable theories by tuning the connecting functions. By adding <em>maximal path</em>and <em>minimal path</em>functions, we obtain a theory of red-black trees in which the transition relation of tree self-balancing (rotation) operations is expressible. We then show how to reduce the verification problem of the red-black tree algorithm to constraint satisfiability problems in the extended theory."

Typically, the proof is performed via induction; however, an assertion, while invariant, may not be inductive (provable via induction). Invariant generation procedures construct auxiliary inductive assertions for strengthening the assertion to be inductive. We describe a general method of generating invariants that is incremental and property-directed. Rather than generating one large auxiliary inductive assertion, our method generates many simple assertions, each of which is inductive relative to those generated before it. Incremental generation is amenable to parallelization. Our method is also property-directed in that it generates inductive assertions that are relevant for strengthening the given assertion. We describe two instances of our method: a procedure for generating clausal invariants of finite-state systems and a procedure for generating affine inequalities of numerical infinite-state systems. We provide evidence that our method scales to checking safety properties of some large finite-state systems."

    "Full Abstract": "Abstract: One of the most sought after software innovation of this decade is the construction of systems using off-the-shelf-workstations that actually deliver and even surpass, the power and reliability of supercomputers. Using completely novel techniques: eager scheduling, evasive memory layouts and dispersed data management it is possible to build an execution environment for parallel programs on workstation networks. These techniques were originally developed in a theoretical framework for an abstract machine which models a shared memory asynchronous multiprocessor. The network of workstations platform presents an inherently asynchronous environment for the execution of our parallel program. This gives rise to substantial problems of correctness of the computation and of proper automatic load balancing of the work amongst the processors, so that a slow processor will not hold up the total computation. A limiting case of asynchrony is when a processor becomes infinitely slow, i.e. fails. Our methodology copes with all these problems, as well as with memory failures. An interesting feature of this system is that it is neither a fault-tolerant system extended for parallel processing nor is it parallel processing system extended for fault tolerance. The same novel mechanisms ensure both properties."

CALYPSO is a prototype software system for writing and executing parallel programs on non-dedicated platforms, based on COTS networked workstations operating systems, and compilers. Among notable properties of the system are: (1) simple programming paradigm incorporating shared memory constructs and separating the programming and the execution parallelism, (2) transparent utilization of unreliable shared resources by providing dynamic load balancing and fault tolerance, and (3) effective performance for large classes of coarse-grained computations. We present the system and report our initial experiments and performance results in settings that closely resemble the dynamic behavior of a \"real\" network.

    "Full Abstract": "Our main result in this paper is a parallel algorithm for suffix--prefix- (s--p-) matching that has optimal speedup on a concurrent-read/concurrent-write parallel random-access machine (CRCW PRAM). Given a string of length $m$, the algorithm runs in time $O(\\log m)$ using $m/ \\log m$ processors. This algorithm is important because we utilize s--p matching as a fundamental building block to solve several pattern- and string-matching problems, such as the following: {1. string matching; 2. multitext/multipattern string matching; 3. multidimensional pattern matching; 4. pattern-occurrence detection; 5. on-line string matching.} In particular, our techniques and algorithms are the first to preserve optimal speedup in the context of pattern matching in higher dimensions and are the only known ones to do so for dimensions $d > 2$."

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645608.661825",
    "Full Abstract": "Adaptive parallel computations-computations that can adapt to changes in resource availability and requirement- can effectively use networked machines because they dynamically expand as machines become available and dynamically acquire machines as needed. While most parallel programming systems provide the means to develop adaptive programs, they do not provide any functional interface to external resource management systems. Thus, no existing resource management system has the capability to manage resources on commodity system software, arbitrating the demands of multiple adaptive computations written using diverse programming environments.This paper presents a set of novel mechanisms that facilitate dynamic allocation of resources to adaptive parallel computations. The mechanisms are built on low-level features common to many programming systems, and unique in their ability to transparently manage multiple adaptive parallel programs that were not developed to have their resources managed by external systems. We also describe the design and the implementation of the initial prototype of ResourceBroker, a resource management system built to validate these mechanisms."

    "Full Abstract": "Parallel computing is becoming increasing central and mainstream, driven both by the widespread availability of commodity SMP and high-performance cluster platforms, as well as the growing use of parallelism in general-purpose applications such as image recognition, virtual reality, and media processing. In addition to performance requirements, the latter computations impose soft real-time constraints, necessitating efficient, predictable parallel resource management. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for increasing parallel system utilization while meeting application soft real-time deadlines. Our approach exploits the application tunability found in several general-purpose computations. Tunability refers to an application's ability to trade off resource requirements over time, while maintaining a desired level of output quality. We first describe language extensions to support tunability in the Calypso system, then characterize the performance benefits of tunability, using a synthetic task system to systematically identify its benefits. Our results show that application tunability is convenient to express and can significantly improve parallel system utilization for computations with predictability requirements."

    "Full Abstract": "Parallel and distributed computing is becoming increasingly mainstream, driven both by the widespread availability of commodity small-scale symmetric multiprocessors and high-performance cluster platforms, as well as the growing use of parallelism and distribution in networked applications such as image recognition, media processing, virtual reality, and telepresence. However, many of these applications impose soft timeliness and output quality constraints on top of the traditional performance requirements, necessitating efficient, predictable management of system resources. Existing techniques are inadequate to simultaneously support these twin requirements of efficiency and predictability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for increasing system efficiency while meeting application timeliness and quality constraints. Our approach exploits the application tunability found in many general-purpose computations. Tunability refers to an application's ability to trade off resource requirements over several dimensions including time, quality, and resource type; the resulting flexibility enables the underlying resource management system to choose an application operating point best suited to available resource characteristics. We describe language and scheduler extensions to support tunability in the MILAN metacomputing environment and then systematically characterize performance benefits of tunability using a parameterizable task system. Our results show that application tunability is easily expressible and can significantly improve resource utilization."

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/509705.509706",
    "Full Abstract": "To exploit parallelism on shared memory parallel computers (SMPCs), it is natural to focus on decomposing the computation (mainly by distributing the iterations of the nested Do-Loops). In contrast, on distributed memory parallel computers (DMPCs), the decomposition of computation and the distribution of data must both be handled---in order to balance the computation load and to minimize the migration of data. We propose and validate experimentally a method for handling computations and data synergistically to minimize the overall execution time on DMPCs. The method is based on a number of novel techniques, also presented in this article. The core idea is to rank the \"importance\" of data arrays in a program and specify some of the dominant. The intuition is that the dominant arrays are the ones whose migration would be the most expensive. Using the correspondence between iteration space mapping vectors and distributed dimensions of the dominant data array in each nested Do-loop, allows us to design algorithms for determining data and computation decompositions at the same time. Based on data distribution, computation decomposition for each nested Do-loop is determined based on either the \"owner computes\" rule or the \"owner stores\" rule with respect to the dominant data array. If all temporal dependence relations across iteration partitions are regular, we use tiling to allow pipelining and the overlapping of computation and communication. However, in order to use tiling on DMPCs, we needed to extend the existing techniques for determining tiling vectors and tile sizes, as they were originally suited for SMPCs only. The overall method is illustrated on programs for the 2D heat equation, for the Gaussian elimination with pivoting, and for the 2D fast Fourier transform on a linear processor array and on a 2D processor grid."

    "Full Abstract": "Discovering frequent itemsets is a key problem in important data mining applications, such as the discovery of association rules, strong rules, episodes, and minimal keys. Typical algorithms for solving this problem operate in a bottom-up, breadth-first search direction. The computation starts from frequent 1-itemsets (the minimum length frequent itemsets) and continues until all maximal (length) frequent itemsets are found. During the execution, every frequent itemset is explicitly considered. Such algorithms perform well when all maximal frequent itemsets are short. However, performance drastically deteriorates when some of the maximal frequent itemsets are long. We present a new algorithm which combines both the bottom-up and the top-down searches. The primary search direction is still bottom-up, but a restricted search is also conducted in the top-down direction. This search is used only for maintaining and updating a new data structure, the maximum frequent candidate set. It is used to prune early candidates that would be normally encountered in the bottom-up search. A very important characteristic of the algorithm is that it does not require explicit examination of every frequent itemset. Therefore, the algorithm performs well even when some maximal frequent itemsets are long. As its output, the algorithm produces the maximum frequent set, i.e., the set containing all maximal frequent itemsets, thus specifying immediately all frequent itemsets. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using well-known synthetic benchmark databases, real-life census, and stock market databases. The improvement in performance can be up to several orders of magnitude, compared to the best previous algorithms."

This novel approach consists of two distinguishing aspects: (i) the design and implementation of embedded systems, using components which are susceptible to perturbations from various sources and (ii) a design methodology which consists of an exploration of a design space which characterizes the trade-off between quality of output and cost, to implement high performance and low energy embedded systems. In contrast with other work, our design methodology does not attempt to correct the errors introduced by components which are susceptible to perturbations, instead we design \"good enough\" systems. Our work has the potential to address challenges and impediments to Moore's law arising from material properties and manufacturing difficulties, which dictate that we shift from the current-day deterministic design paradigm to statistical and probabilistic designs of the future. In this paper, we provide a broad overview of our work on probabilistic and approximate design, present novel results in approximate arithmetic and its impact on digital signal processing algorithms, and sketch future directions for research."

In this work, we answer this open question (or, natural query), by showing that when running concurrently with other protocols UCZK in the CRS model can lose proof of knowledge (POK) property that is very essential and core security implication of the ZK functionality. This is demonstrated by concrete attack against naturally existing UCZK protocols in the CRS model. Then, motivated by our attack, we make further clarifications of the underlying reasons beneath the concrete attack, and investigate the precise security guarantee of UC with CRS."

However, when transactions are concurrent, say over the Internet, with players possessing public keys (as is common in cryptography), assuring that entities \"know\" what they claim to know, where adversaries may be well coordinated across different transactions, turns out to be much more subtle and in need of re-examination. In such settings, mixing the public-key structure as part of the language and statements is a natural adversarial strategy. Here, we investigate how to formally treat knowledge possession by parties interacting concurrently in the public-key model. More technically, we look into the relative power of the notion of \"concurrent knowledge extraction\" (CKE) for concurrent zero knowledge (CZK) in the bare public-key (BPK) model, where the language and statements being proved can be dynamically and adaptively chosen by the prover and may be possibly based on verifiers' public keys. By concrete attacks against some existing natural protocols, we first show that concurrent soundness and normal arguments of knowledge do not guarantee concurrent verifier security in the public-key setting. Here, roughly speaking, concurrent verifier security says that the malicious concurrent prover should \"know\" all the witnesses to all the possibly public-key-related statements adaptively chosen and successfully proved in the concurrent sessions. These concrete attacks serve as a good motivation for understanding \"possession of knowledge\" for concurrent transactions with registered public keys, i.e., the subtleties of concurrent knowledge extraction in the public-key model. This motivates us to introduce and formalize the notion of CKE, along with clarifications of various subtleties. Two implementations are then presented for constant-round concurrently knowledge extractable concurrent zero-knowledge (CZK---CKE) argument for $$\\mathcal {NP}$$NP in the BPK model: One protocol is generic and based on standard polynomial-time assumptions, whereas the other protocol is computationally efficient and employs complexity leveraging in a novel way. Both protocols can be practically instantiated for some specific number-theoretic languages without going through general $$\\mathcal {NP}$$NP-reductions. Of independent interest are the discussions about the subtleties surrounding the fundamental structure of Feige---Shamir zero knowledge in the BPK model."

    "Full Abstract": "One of the major open problems in machine learning is to characterize generalization in the overparameterized regime, where most traditional generalization bounds become inconsistent even for overparameterized linear regression [46]. In many scenarios, this failure can be attributed to obscuring the crucial interplay between the training algorithm and the underlying data distribution. This paper demonstrate that the generalization behavior of overparameterized model should be analyzed in a both data-relevant and algorithm-relevant manner. To make a formal characterization, We introduce a notion called data-algorithm compatibility, which considers the generalization behavior of the entire data-dependent training trajectory, instead of traditional last-iterate analysis. We validate our claim by studying the setting of solving overparameterized linear regression with gradient descent. Specifically, we perform a data-dependent trajectory analysis and derive a sufficient condition for compatibility in such a setting. Our theoretical results demonstrate that if we take early stopping iterates into consideration, generalization can hold with significantly weaker restrictions on the problem instance than the previous last-iterate analysis."

    "Full Abstract": "We present an immersive system for exploring numerically simulated flow data through a model of a coronary artery graft. This tightly-coupled interdisciplinary project is aimed at understanding how to reduce the failure rate of these grafts. The visualization system provides a mechanism for exploring the effect of changes to the geometry, to the flow, and for exploring potential sources of future lesions. The system uses gestural and voice interactions exclusively, moving away from more traditional windows/icons/menus/point-and-click (WIMP) interfaces.We present an example session using the system and discuss our experiences developing, testing, and using it. We describe some of the interaction and rendering techniques that we experimented with and describe their level of success. Our experience suggests that systems like this are exciting to clinical researchers, but conclusive evidence of their value is not yet available."

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3342220.3344782",
    "Full Abstract": "2019 marks not only the 30th anniversary of the falling of the Berlin Wall, but also the 50th anniversaries of equally momentous events of 1968-1969 in the US and elsewhere. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated. Hippie \"flower power\" and the closely related anti-Vietnam war movement were socio-political revolutions. In Europe, 2019 marks the 100th anniversary of the end of the \"war to end all wars\" and the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Counterpointing this societal turmoil, technology gave us hope. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon. Doug Engelbart and his team presented the \"Mother of All Demos\" of NLS at the '68 Fall Joint Computer Conference. Ivan Sutherland's pioneering Sketchpad (that demo'd interactive graphics in 1963) and Engelbart's NLS demo were two landmark events that were early examples of interactive computing in an era of batch computation. Interactive computing on time-sharing systems, combined with microminiaturization, would lead more than a decade later to the birth of the personal computer. It caused a revolution in the dominant model of computing that was centered on large mainframes and minicomputers used for science and engineering, finance and commerce. Interactive computing based on computer graphics and its use in hypermedia systems characterizes most of my research career. In 2019, it is difficult to remember the impact that interaction-based information structuring and sharing had on society; it certainly shaped my research career. In this presentation, I will reflect on the development of five decades of hypermedia systems and will demo three systems that have been highlights of my journey in hyperland. First, I'll show our FRESS hypertext system (still running 50-year old assembly code!), with the database of poetry used by a class of English students in 1976 in what is arguably the first online scholarly community. Next, I will demo our TAG (Touch Art Gallery) used by the Nobel Foundation a few years ago for a traveling exhibition on Alfred Nobel and all the Nobel Laureates. Finally, I'll interweave the hypertext-centric parts of my talk with some source material stored in an unbounded 2D workspace, using our current hypermedia system Dash, which is still under development and in an early but already useful state. These systems will be presented in the context of the research trends that led, ultimately, to the interconnected society in which we live. All of us working on our first hypertext systems in the '60s understood the potential of this technology. What I did not predict is that 50 years later the revolution in human-centered computing would remain far too unfinished in terms of its positive societal impact. Indeed, that impact and utility are increasingly in jeopardy from a variety of forces, both economic and political. I will close with some thoughts on both deliberately designed and unanticipated societal issues of social media that I feel we technologists must urgently help address."

    "Full Abstract": "Popular application suites, as well as specialized apps, are designed for workflows in which users focus on a single task for extended periods of time. These application silos slow down the many other workflows that require users to move with agility between tasks in a single working session. This is particularly true for creative people who have personalized patterns of gathering, organizing, and presenting information from a variety of sources. Moreover, each application comes with its own learning curve and data model, restricting users seeking to extend their workflows and in some cases, losing data through poor data transferring mechanisms such as clipboard copy and paste."

In this paper, we investigate a new approach to detecting interviewer fabrication automatically. We instrument electronic data collection software to record logs of low-level behavioral data and show that supervised classification, when applied to features extracted from these logs, can identify interviewer fabrication with an accuracy of up to 96%. We show that even when interviewers know that our approach is being used, have some knowledge of how it works, and are incentivized to avoid detection, it can still achieve an accuracy of 86%. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach to a moderate amount of label noise and provide practical recommendations, based on empirical evidence, on how much data is needed for our approach to be effective."

In particular, we show that a very desirable benchmark proposed by Hartline and Roughgarden is too strong, in the sense that no truthful mechanism can compete with it even in a very simple non-matroid setting where there are two exclusive markets and the seller can only sell to agents in one of them. On the other hand, we show that there is a mechanism that competes with a symmetrized version of this benchmark. We further investigate the more traditional best fixed price profit benchmark and show that there are mechanisms that compete with it in any downward-closed settings."

We introduce a variant of the generalized VCG auction with reserve prices and random admission, and show that this auction gives a constant approximation to the optimal expected revenue in matroid environments. Our results do not require any assumptions on the signal distributions, however, they require the value functions to satisfy a standard single-crossing property and a concavity-type condition."

In both contexts, we demonstrate that dynamic position auctions converge to their associated static, envy-free equilibria. Furthermore, convergence is efficient, and the entry of low-quality advertisers does not slow convergence. Because our approach predominantly relies on assumptions common in the sponsored search literature, our results suggest that dynamic position auctions converge more generally."

We show how to derive subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium strategies in this game and analyze the impact the competition has on the quality of the hires as a function of the rank of the employer. We present numerical results from simulations of these strategies."

The consumer discovers his value for the good only as he uses it, and the value evolves with each use. Optimizing for the seller's revenue in such dynamic settings is a complex problem and requires assumptions about how the buyer behaves before learning his future value(s), and in particular, how he reacts to risk. We explore the performance of a class of pricing mechanisms that are extremely simple for both the buyer and the seller to use: the buyer reacts to prices myopically without worrying about how his value evolves in the future; the seller needs to optimize for revenue over a space of only two parameters, and can do so without knowing the buyer's risk profile or fine details of the value evolution process. We present simple-versus-optimal type results, namely that under certain assumptions, simple pricing mechanisms of the above form are approximately optimal"

Relevant examples include energy, computing resources on a cloud computing platform, and charging stations for electric vehicles, among many others. A client/job in this setting has a window of time during which he needs service, and a particular value for obtaining it. We assume a stochastic model for demand, where each job materializes with some probability via an independent Bernoulli trial. Given a per-time-unit pricing of resources, any realized job will first try to get served by the cheapest available resource in its window and, failing that, will try to find service at the next cheapest available resource, and so on. Thus, the natural stochastic fluctuations in demand have the potential to lead to cascading overload events. Our main result shows that setting prices so as to optimally handle the"

    "Full Abstract": "The Bitcoin protocol induces miners, through monetary rewards, to expend energy in order to add blocks to the chain. We show that, when energy costs are substantial and taken into account, counterintuitive and unintended strategic behavior results: In a simple bounded-horizon setting with two identical miners there is a unique pure symmetric equilibrium in which both miners first \"slow down\" in order to decrease the crypto complexity and then take advantage of this decrease. If miners have different energy efficiencies and are restricted to choose the same hash rate for many epochs, there is a unique pure equilibrium in which miners either participate at low levels that depend in intricate ways on all the other miners' efficiencies, or choose to abstain from mining if their efficiency is too low. In the general setting in which miners can adapt their hash rates over time, we show that, unless the number of miners is very small, the only possible pure equilibria are rather chaotic, with miners quitting and starting again periodically --- or there is no pure equilibrium at all. We discuss the implications of these results for the stability of proof-of-work protocols."

So, if the conjecture of Schalekamp et al. holds true, our result shows that the integrality gap of the subtour polytope is bounded away from 3/2."

    "Full Abstract": "We investigate non-adaptive algorithms for matroid prophet inequalities. Matroid prophet inequalities have been considered resolved since 2012 when [KW12] introduced thresholds that guarantee a tight 2-approximation to the prophet; however, this algorithm is adaptive. Other approaches of [CHMS10] and [FSZ16] have used non-adaptive thresholds with a feasibility restriction on the items that can be taken; however, this translates to adaptively changing an itemâs threshold to infinity when it cannot be taken with respect to the additional feasibility constraint, hence the algorithm is not truly non-adaptive. A major application of prophet inequalities is in auction design, where non-adaptive prices possess a significant advantage: they convert to order-oblivious posted pricings, and are essential for translating a prophet inequality into a truthful mechanism for multi-dimensional buyers. The existing matroid prophet inequalities do not suffice for this application. We present the first non-adaptive constant-factor prophet inequality for graphic matroids."

A behavioural theory is established, using the categorical notion of relative pushout; it allows labelled transition systems to be derived uniformly for a wide variety of BRSs, in such a way that familiar behavioural preorders and equivalences, in particular bisimilarity, are congruential.

    "Full Abstract": "Nowadays, microkernel-based systems are getting studied and adopted with a renewed interest in a wide number of IT scenarios. Their advantages over classical monolithic solutions mainly concern the dependability domain. By being capable of dynamically detect and solve non-expected behaviours within its core components, a microkernel-based OS would eventually run forever with no need to be restarted. Dependability in this context mainly aims at isolating components from a spatial point of view: a microkernel-based system may definitely not be adopted in the context of real-time environments, simply basing on this kind of protection only."

The pursuit of this principle, using capability-oriented mechanisms in preference to access control lists, has led to a filing system in which a preserved capability may be retrieved from different directories to achieve different access statuses, in which the significance of a text name depends on the directory to which it is presented, and in which filing system 'privilege' is expressed by possession of directory capabilities."

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1390334.1390404",
    "Full Abstract": "The primary business model behind Web search is based on textual advertising, where contextually relevant ads are displayed alongside search results. We address the problem of selecting these ads so that they are both relevant to the queries and profitable to the search engine, showing that optimizing ad relevance and revenue is not equivalent. Selecting the best ads that satisfy these constraints also naturally incurs high computational costs, and time constraints can lead to reduced relevance and profitability. We propose a novel two-stage approach, which conducts most of the analysis ahead of time. An offine preprocessing phase leverages additional knowledge that is impractical to use in real time, and rewrites frequent queries in a way that subsequently facilitates fast and accurate online matching. Empirical evaluation shows that our method optimized for relevance matches a state-of-the-art method while improving expected revenue. When optimizing for revenue, we see even more substantial improvements in expected revenue."

    "Full Abstract": "Translation validation is a technique for ensuring that a translator, such as a compiler, produces correct results. Because complete verification of the translator itself is often infeasible, translation validation advocates coupling the verification task with the translation task, so that each run of the translator produces verification conditions which, if valid, prove the correctness of the translation. In previous work, the translation validation approach was used to give a framework for proving the correctness of a variety of compiler optimizations, with a recent focus on loop transformations. However, some of these ideas were preliminary and had not been implemented. Additionally, there were examples of common loop transformations which could not be handled by our previous approaches. This paper addresses these issues. We introduce a new rule Reduce for loop reduction transformations, and we generalize our previous rule Validate so that it can handle more transformations involving loops. We then describe how all of this (including some previous theoretical work) is implemented in our compiler validation tool TVOC."

RFID attacks are currently conceived as properly formatted but fake RFID data; however no one expects an RFID tag to send a SQL injection attack or a buffer overflow. This paper is meant to serve as a warning that data from RFID tags can be used to exploit back-end software systems. RFID middleware writers must therefore build appropriate checks (bounds checking, special character filtering, etc.), to prevent RFID middleware from suffering all of the well-known vulnerabilities experienced by the Internet. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, this paper presents the first self-replicating RFID virus. This virus uses RFID tags as a vector to compromise backend RFID middleware systems, via a SQL injection attack."

    "Full Abstract": "The paper studies automatic verification of liveness properties with probability 1 over parameterized programs that include probabilistic transitions, and proposes two novel approaches to the problem. The first approach is based on a Planner that occasionally determines the outcome of a finite sequence of \"random\" choices, while the other random choices are performed non-deterministically. Using a Planner, a probabilistic protocol can be treated just like a nonprobabilistic one and verified as such. The second approach is based on Î³-fairness, a notion of fairness that is sound and complete for verifying simple temporal properties (whose only temporal operators are â and â¡) over finite-state systems. The paper presents a symbolic model checker based on Î³-fairness.We then show how the network invariant approach can be adapted to accommodate probabilistic protocols. The utility of the Planner approach is demonstrated on a probabilistic mutual exclusion protocol. The utility of the approach of Î³-fairness with network invariants is demonstrated on Lehman and Rabin's Courteous Philosophers algorithm."

All of these featuresare done in a platform- and application-independentway, so the results are quite general. The basic idea behindthe scheme is to have each object owner issue cryptographicallysealed certificates to users to prove which operationsthey may request and to servers to prove which operationsthey are authorized to execute. These certificates are usedto ensure secure binding and secure method invocation. Thepaper discusses the required certificates and security protocolsfor using them."

    "Full Abstract": "The paper presents a method, called the method of verification by invisible invariants, for the automatic verification of a large class of parameterized systems. The method is based on the automatic calculation of candidate inductive assertions and checking for their inductiveness, using symbolic model-checking techniques for both tasks. First, we show how to use model-checking techniques over finite (and small) instances of the parameterized system in order to derive candidates for invariant assertions. Next, we show that the premises of the standard deductive INV rule for proving invariance properties can be automatically resolved by finite-state (BDD-based) methods with no need for interactive theorem proving. Combining the automatic computation of invariants with the automatic resolution of the VCs (verification conditions) yields a (necessarily) incomplete but fully automatic sound method for verifying large classes of parameterized systems. The generated invariants can be transferred to the VC-validation phase without ever been examined by the user, which explains why we refer to them as \"invisible\". The efficacy of the method is demonstrated by automatic verification of diverse parameterized systems in a fully automatic and efficient manner."

An object can be a telephone or a notebook computer, but also a software or data object, such as a file or an electronic document. Our service strictly separates an object's name from the addresses where it can be contacted. This is done by introducing a location-independent object handle. An object's name is bound to its unique object handle, which, in turn, is mapped to the addresses where the object can be contacted. To locate an object, we need only its object handle. We present a scalable location service based on a worldwide distributed search tree that adapts dynamically to an object's migration pattern to optimize lookups and updates"

We propose a framework in which such strategies can be devised independently per Web document.A Web document is constructed as a worldwide, scalable distributed Web object. Depending on the coherence requirements for that document, the most appropriate caching or replication strategy can subsequently be implemented and encapsulated by the Web object. Coherence requirements are formulated from two different perspectives: that of the Web object, and that of clients using the Web object. We have developed a prototype in Java to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing different strategies for different Web objects."

In order to be a practical alternative to compiler verification, a key feature of this validation is its full automation."

    "Full Abstract": "When designing distributed systems, one is faced with the problem of verifying a refinement between two specifications, given at different levels of abstraction. Suggested verification techniques in the literature include refinement mappings and various forms of simulation. We present a verification method, in which refinement between two systems is proven by constructing a transducer that inputs a computation of a concrete system and outputs a matching computation of the abstract system. The transducer uses a FIFO queue that holds segments of the concrete computation that have not been matched yet. This allows a finite delay between the occurrence of a concrete event and the determination of the corresponding abstract event. This delay often makes the use of prophecy variables or backward simulation unnecessary.An important generalization of the method is to prove refinement modulo some transformation on the observed sequences of events. The method is adapted by replacing the FIFO queue by a component that allows the appropriate transformation on sequences of events. A particular case is partial-order refinement, i.e., refinement that preserves only a subset of the orderings between events of a system. Examples are sequential consistency and serializability. The case of sequential consistency is illustrated on a proof of sequential consistency of a cache protocol."

In conjunction with dynamically typed object enumerators, non-rigid functions allow to embed notions of object-orientation in dynamic logic, thereby forming a basis for verification of object-oriented programs. A semantical generalisation of substitutions, called state update, which we add to the logic, constitutes the central technical device for dealing with object aliasing during function modification. With these few extensions, our dynamic logic captures the essential aspects of the complex verification system KeY and, hence, constitutes a foundation for object-oriented verification with the principles of reasoning that underly the successful KeY case studies."

In this paper, we consider the extension of branching temporal logics with past-time operators. Two possible views regarding the nature of past in a branching- time model induce two different such extensions. In the first view, past is branching and each moment in time may have several possible futures and several possible pasts. In the second view, past is linear and each moment in time may have several possible futures and a unique past. Both views assume that past is finite. We discuss the practice of these extensions as specification languages, characterize their expressive power, and examine the complexity of their model-checking and satisfiability problems."

The advantages of this extended temporal logic is that its expressive power is strictly higher than that of the un-quantified version (\\ptl) and is equal to that of S1S, as well as that of \\omega-automata. Another important application of \\qptl\\ is its use for formulating and verifying refinement relations between reactive systems. In fact, the completeness proof is based on the reduction of a \\qptl\\ formula into a \\buchi\\ automaton, and performing equivalence transformations on this automata, formally justifying these transformations."

    "Full Abstract": "Based on an empirical study of more than 10,000 lines of program text written in a GOTO-less language, a machine architecture specifically designed for structured programs is proposed. Since assignment, CALL, RETURN, and IF statements together account for 93 percent of all executable statements, special care is given to ensure that these statements can be implemented efficiently. A highly compact instruction encoding scheme is presented, which can reduce program size by a factor of 3. Unlike a Huffman code, which utilizes variable length fields, this method uses only fixed length (1-byte) opcode and address fields. The most frequent instructions consist of a single 1-byte field. As a consequence, instruction decoding time is minimized, and the machine is efficient with respect to both space and time."

The technique consists of feeding a description of the language to be translated to a general-purpose macro processor. Used in this way, the macro processor functions as a compiler-compiler, providing automatic parsing, lexical scanning, symbol table operations, and handling of syntactic errors. A complete syntactic and semantic description of a WHILE statement (except for Boolean expression processing) is given in only seven lines, as an example. A system programming language implemented by this method is discussed in order to illustrate the main ideas. The compiler produced for this language is compared to other compilers produced by conventional methods."

It is shown that, by imposing the crucial condition of <i>finite variability,</i> we achieve a balanced formalism that is insensitive to <i>finite</i> stuttering, but can recognize <i>infinite</i> stuttering, a distinction which is essential for obtaining a fully abstract semantics of non-terminating processes. Among other advantages, going into real-based semantics obviates the need for the controversial representation of concurrency by interleaving, and most of the associated fairness constraints."

    "Full Abstract": "The paper describes the compilation of a program specification, written in the very high level nonprocedural MODEL language, into an object, PL/1 or Cobol, procedural language program. Nonprocedural programming languages are descriptive and devoid of procedural controls. They are therefore easier to use and require less programming skills than procedural languages. The MODEL language is briefly presented and illustrated followed by a description of the compilation process. An important early phase in the compilation is the representation of the specification by a dependency graph, denoted as array graph, which expresses the data flow interdependencies between statements. Two classes of algorithms which utilize this graph are next described. The first class checks various completeness, nonambiguity, and consistency aspects of the specification. Upon detecting any problems, the system attempts some automatic correcting measures which are reported to the user, or alternately, when no corrections appear as reasonable, it reports the error and solicits a modification from the user. The second class of algorithms produces an intermediate design of an object program in a language independent form. Finally, PL/1 or Cobol code is generated."

We introduce an interval temporal logic that allows us to make assertions of the form âin the next k units, X holds.â This logic encodes intuitive arguments about contention protocols quite directly. We present two proofs of an Ethernet-like contention protocol, one using the interval temporal logic and one using classical temporal logic. We also verify a contention-free protocol using an invariant that seems to have wide applicability for such protocols."

However, checking whether a particular graph is a good expander is co-NP-complete. We show that the second eigenvalue of d-regular graphs, Î»2, is concentrated in an interval of width O(âd) around its mean, and that its mean is O(d3/4). The result holds under various models for random d-regular graphs. As a consequence a random d-regular graph on n vertices, is, with high probability a certifiable efficient expander for n sufficiently large. The bound on the width of the interval is derived from martingale theory and the bound on E(Î»2) is obtained by exploring the properties of random walks in random graphs."

The approach taken here is distinguished by relatively simple semantic domains and ordering."

The main result of the present paper is: The validity problem for PDL with additional programs Î±Î(Î²)Î³Î for regular Î±, Î² and Î³, defined as UiÎ±i; Î²; Î³i, is Î 11-complete.

    "Full Abstract": "The asynchronous execution behavior of several concurrent processes, which may use randomization, is studied. Viewing each process as a discrete Markov chain over the set of common execution states, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the processes to converge almost surely to a given set of goal states, under any fair, but otherwise arbitrary schedule, provided that the state space is finite. (These conditions can be checked mechanically.) An interesting feature of the proof method is that it depends only on the topology of the transitions and not on the actual values of the probabilities. We also show that in our model synchronization protocols that use randomization are in certain cases no more powerful than deterministic protocols. This is demonstrated by (a) Proving lower bounds on the size of a shared variable necessary to ensure mutual exlusion and lockout-free behavior of the protocol; and (b) Showing that no fully symmetric 'randomized' protocol can ensure mutual exclusion and freedom from lockout."

The approach is similar to Hoare's approach [3] for proving that a program is \"partially correct\" (i.e., that whenever it terminates it produces correct results). Our extension to Hoare's method lies in the possibility of proving both correctness and termination by one unified formalism. One can choose to prove total correctness by a single step, or by incremental proof steps, each step establishing more properties of the program."

    "Full Abstract": "A distributed operating system provides the same functionality and interface as a monolithic operating system. That is, for both systems the goal is to make the computing and storage facilities as provided by the hardware available to the users of the system. In distributed operating system new hardware can be added to the system to increase the storage or computing power, or to increase the availability of the storage and computing services. During and after this addition, the interface to the system remains unchanged. Transparency of access is a key concept.The top-level interface consists of sophisticated command interpreters and editors, supported by a high-resolution graphical window system. This software is run by workstations. Workstations are powerful computer units, consisting of a CPU, memory, a bitmap display, keyboard, a pointing device such as a mouse, and a network interface. In addition, workstations are often equipped with a disk. The CPU is at least as powerful as those used in traditional computer systems, and the amount of memory is equivalent or even larger.A workstation is dedicated to one individual. Consequently, the workstation is idle most of the time. It is therefore tempting to use it as the main computing resource for the owner and perhaps others as well. It could also be used autonomously from the rest of the system in case of a failure. We are opposed to these uses of workstations, since we believe that workstations should only provide the top-level interface. In this paper we will outline our reasons for this, and show how this principle has been applied in the Amoeba distributed operating system."

    "Full Abstract": "Distributed operating systems have been in the experimental stage for a number of years now, but few have progressed to the point of actually being used in a production environment. It is our belief that the reason lies primarily with the performance of these systems---they tend to be fairly slow compared to traditional single computer systems. The Amoeba system has been designed with high performance in mind. In this paper some performance measurements of Amoeba are presented and comparisons are made with UNIX on the SUN, as well as with some other interesting systems. In particular, short remote procedure calls take 1.4 msec and long data transfers achieve a user-to-user bandwidth of 677 kbytes/sec. Furthermore, the file server is so fast that it is limited by the communication bandwidth to 677 kbytes/sec. The real speed of the file server is too high to measure. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best figures yet reported in the literature for the class of hardware used."

Amoeba has a unique, fast file system split into two parts: the bullet service stores immutable files contiguously on the disk; the directory service gives capabilities symbolic names and handles replication and atomicity, eliminating the need for a separate transaction management system.

We will then proceed to identify future challenges and directions that may extend the applicability of TL to wider classes of applications and the treatment of ever larger systems. We start by identifying the class of reactive systems for whose specification and verification TL has proved to be a most natural and effective language. These are systems whose role is to maintain an ongoing interaction with their environment, rather than produce a final result on termination. Most, embedded systems which control an external physical environment be-long to this important class. Such systems must be specified and analyzed in terms of their behavior."

In order to be a practical alternative to compiler verification, a key feature of this validation is its full automation."

    "Full Abstract": "Instruction scheduling is central to achieving performance in modern processors with instruction level parallelism (ILP). Classical work in this area has spanned the theoretical foundations of algorithms for instruction scheduling with provable optimality, as well as heuristic approaches with experimentally validated performance improvements. Typically, the theoretical foundations are developed in the context of basic-blocks of code. In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundations for scheduling basic-blocks of instructions with time-constraints, which can play an important role in compile-time ILP optimizations in embedded applications. We present an algorithm for scheduling unit-execution-time instructions on machines with multiple pipelines, in the presence of precedence constraints, release-times, deadlines, and latencies $l_{ij}$ between any pairs of instructions $i$ and $j$. Our algorithm runs in time $O(n^3\\alpha(n))$, where $\\alpha(n)$ is the functional inverse of the Ackermann function. It can be used construct feasible schedules for two classes of instances:one pipeline and the latencies between instructions are restricted to the values of 0 and 1, and arbitrary number of pipelines and monotone-interval order precedences. %The algorithm can also be used to construct minimal tardiness %schedules in polynomial time. Our result can be seen as a natural extension of previous work on instruction scheduling for pipelined machines in the presence of deadlines."

    "Full Abstract": "There is a large class of circuits (including pipeline and out-of-order execution components) which can be formally verified while completely ignoring the precise characteristics (e.g. word-size) of the data manipulated by the circuits. In the literature, this is often described as the use of uninterpreted functions, implying that the concrete operations applied to the data are abstracted into unknown and featureless functions. In this paper, we briefly introduce an abstract unifying model for such data-insensitive circuits, and claim that the development of such models, perhaps even a theory of circuit schemas, can significantly contribute to the development of efficient and comprehensive verification algorithms combining deductive as well as enumerative methods.As a case study, we present in this paper an algorithm for out-of-order execution with in-order retirement and show it to be a refinement of the sequential instruction execution algorithm. Refinement is established by deductively proving (using pvs) that the register files of the out-of-order algorithm and the sequential algorithm agree at all times if the two systems are synchronized at instruction retirement time."

In particular, we show that even a single step of continuous image computation is not semidecidable numerically even for a very restricted class of functions. Moreover, we show that symbolic insight about derivative bounds provides sufficient additional information for approximation refinement model checking. Finally, we prove that purely numerical algorithms can perform continuous image computation with arbitrarily high probability. Using these results, we analyze the prerequisites for a safe operation of the roundabout maneuver in air traffic collision avoidance."

    "Full Abstract": "We propose a first-order dynamic logic for reasoning about hybrid systems. As a uniform model for discrete and continuous evolutions in hybrid systems, we introduce hybrid programs with differential actions. Our logic can be used to specify and verify correctness statements about hybrid programs, which are suitable for symbolic processing by calculus rules. Using first-order variables, our logic supports systems with symbolic parameters. With dynamic modalities, it is prepared to handle multiple system components."

    "Full Abstract": "In this paper, we present an abstraction refinement approach for model checking safety properties of real-time systems using SAT-solving. We present a faithful embedding of bounded model checking for systems of timed automata into propositional logic with linear arithmetic and prove correctness. With this logical representation, we achieve a linear-size representation of parallel composition and introduce a quick abstraction technique that works uniformly for clocks, events, and states. When necessary, abstractions are refined by analysing spurious counterexamples using a promising extension of counterexample-guided abstraction refinement with syntactic information about Craig interpolants. To support generalisations, our overall approach identifies the algebraic and logical principles required for logic-based abstraction refinement."

    "Full Abstract": "We introduce a hybrid variant of a dynamic logic with continuous state transitions along differential equations, and we present a sequent calculus for this extended hybrid dynamic logic. With the addition of satisfaction operators, this hybrid logic provides improved system introspection by referring to properties of states during system evolution. In addition to this, our calculus introduces state-based reasoning as a paradigm for delaying expansion of transitions using nominals as symbolic state labels. With these extensions, our hybrid dynamic logic advances the capabilities for compositional reasoning about (semialgebraic) hybrid dynamic systems. Moreover, the constructive reasoning support for goal-oriented analytic verification of hybrid dynamic systems carries over from the base calculus to our extended calculus."

    "Full Abstract": "We combine first-order dynamic logic for reasoning about possible behaviour of hybrid systems with temporal logic for reasoning about the temporal behaviour during their operation. Our logic supports verification of hybrid programs with first-order definable flows and provides a uniform treatment of discrete and continuous evolution. For our combined logic, we generalise the semantics of dynamic modalities to refer to hybrid traces instead of final states. Further, we prove that this gives a conservative extension of dynamic logic. On this basis, we provide a modular verification calculus that reduces correctness of temporal behaviour of hybrid systems to non-temporal reasoning. Using this calculus, we analyse safety invariants in a train control system and symbolically synthesise parametric safety constraints."

Using this model, a programmer defines and invokes operations on shared objects, the runtime system handles reads and writes on these objects, and the reliable broadcast layer implements indivisible updates to objects using the sequencing protocol. The resulting system is easy to program, easy to build, and has acceptable performance on problems with a moderate grain size in which reads are much more common than writes. Orca, a procedural language whose sequential constructs are roughly similar to languages like C or Modula 2 but which also supports parallel processes and shared objects and has been used to develop applications for the prototype system, is described."

Distributed applications, however, have different requirements (e.g., efficient at-most-once remote procedure call even in the face of processor failures). Instead of using ad hoc protocols to meet each of the new requirements, we have designed a new protocol, called the Fast Local Internet Protocol (FLIP), that provides a clean and simple integrated approach to these new requirements. FLIP is an unreliable message protocol that provides both point-to-point communication and multicast communication, and requires almost no network management. Furthermore, by using FLIP we have simplified higher-level protocols such as remote procedure call and group communication, and enhanced support for process migration and security. A prototype implementation of FLIP has been built as part of the new kernel for the Amoeba distributed operating system, and is in daily use. Measurements of its performance are presented."

These delegates may include validation programs, correctness provers, and system administrators. The main advantage of certifications is that it can handle trust and sharing in a non-cooperative environment."

    "Full Abstract": "Distributed systems provide sharing of resources and information over a computer network. A key design issue that makes these systems attractive is that all aspects related to distribution are transparent to users. Unfortunately, general-purpose wide area distributed systems that allow users to share and manage arbitrary resources in a transparent way hardly exist. In particular, they generally do not take into account the most important properties that characterize wide area systems: 1) A very large number of users and resources, 2) an inherent latency problem caused by the distance between nodes, 3) heterogeneity due to a variety of underlying operating systems and networks, and 4) involvement of multiple administrative organizations.The research described in this paper is part of the Globe Project (Globe stands for GLobal Object Based Environment). The goal of this project is the design and implementation of a wide area distributed system that provides a convenient programming abstraction and full transparency. The main contribution of this paper is the description of a new system for distributed shared objects. In contrast to other systems, the implementation of distribution, consistency, and replication of state is completely encapsulated in a distributed shared object. This allows for object-specific solutions, and provides the right mechanism for building efficient and truly scalable systems."

These objects offer user-defined operations on shared state, but allow for efficient implementations through replication and distribution of state. In contrast to other object-based models, these implementation aspects are completely hidden from applications."

The method consists of a two-step process by which, in a first step, the system and its temporal specification are jointly abstracted into a finite-state system and a finite-state specification. The second step uses model checking to establish the validity of the abstracted property over the abstracted system. The VFA method can be considered a viable alternative to verification by temporal deduction which, up to now, has been the main method generally applicable for verification of infinite-state systems. The paper presents a general recipe for the joint abstraction, which is shown to be sound, where soundness means that validity over the abstract system implies validity over the concrete (original) system. To make the method applicable for the verification of liveness properties, pure abstraction is sometimes no longer adequate. We show that by augmenting the system by an appropriate (and standardly constructible) progress monitor, we obtain an augmented system, whose computations are essentially the same as the original system, and which may now be abstracted while preserving the desired liveness properties. We refer to the extended method as verification by augmented abstraction (VAA). We then proceed to show that the VAA method is sound and complete for proving all properties expressible by temporal logic (including both safety and liveness). Completeness establishes that whenever the property is valid, there exists a finitary abstraction which abstracts the system, augmented by an appropriate progress monitor, into a finite-state system which validated the abstracted property."

We assume that the negation of the property to be verified is given by the user in the form of an infinite-state nondeterministic B chi discrete system (bds). The method consists of a two-step process by which, in a first step, the system and its (negated) specification are combined into a single infinite-state fair discrete system (fds, which is similar to a bds but with Streett acceptance conditions), which is abstracted into a finite-state automaton. The second step uses model checking to establish that the abstracted automaton is infeasible, i.e., has no computations. The vfa method can be considered as a viable alternative to verification by temporal deduction, which, up to now, has been the main method generally applicable for verification of infinite-state systems. The paper presents a general recipe for an fds abstraction, which is shown to be sound, where soundness means that infeasibility of the abstracted fds implies infeasibility of the unabstracted one, implying in turn the validity of the property over the concrete (infinite-state) system.

We then present the constraint mass assignment representation, which models the world with a set of probability distributions and is a generalization of mass assignment representations. Within this framework, we present sound abstraction procedures for three types of action abstraction. We end the paper with discussions and related work on sound and approximate abstraction. We give pointers to papers in which we discuss other sound abstraction-related issues, including applications, estimating loss due to abstraction, and automatically generating abstraction hierarchies."

At the focus of our analysis is the probability crossÃ½product operator and its interval generalization, the ccÃ½operator. We perform an extensive study of these operators relative to manipulation of sets of probability distributions. This study provides insight into the sources of the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to handling probability intervals.

We then focus on plan coverage as an important utility measure.

In doing so, we provide the first method for effectively integrating the use of quantitative information into the query optimizer of a data-integration system.

    "Full Abstract": "A data-integration system provides access to a multitude of data sources through a single mediated schema. A key bottleneck in building such systems has been the laborious manual construction of semantic mappings between the source schemas and the mediated schema. We describe LSD, a system that employs and extends current machine-learning techniques to semi-automatically find such mappings. LSD first asks the user to provide the semantic mappings for a small set of data sources, then uses these mappings together with the sources to train a set of learners. Each learner exploits a different type of information either in the source schemas or in their data. Once the learners have been trained, LSD finds semantic mappings for a new data source by applying the learners, then combining their predictions using a meta-learner. To further improve matching accuracy, we extend machine learning techniques so that LSD can incorporate domain constraints as an additional source of knowledge, and develop a novel learner that utilizes the structural information in XML documents. Our approach thus is distinguished in that it incorporates multiple types of knowledge. Importantly, its architecture is extensible to additional learners that may exploit new kinds of information. We describe a set of experiments on several real-world domains, and show that LSD proposes semantic mappings with a high degree of accuracy."

    "Full Abstract": "Ontologies play a prominent role on the Semantic Web. They make possible the widespread publication of machine understandable data, opening myriad opportunities for automated information processing. However, because of the Semantic Web's distributed nature, data on it will inevitably come from many different ontologies. Information processing across ontologies is not possible without knowing the semantic mappings between their elements. Manually finding such mappings is tedious, error-prone, and clearly not possible at the Web scale. Hence, the development of tools to assist in the ontology mapping process is crucial to the success of the Semantic Web.We describe"

As a means for combining local differential invariants into global system invariants in a sound way, our fixedpoint algorithm works with a compositional verification logic for hybrid systems. To improve the verification power, we further introduce a <em>saturation procedure</em>that refines the system dynamics successively with differential invariants until safety becomes provable. By complementing our symbolic verification algorithm with a robust version of numerical falsification, we obtain a fast and sound verification procedure. We verify roundabout maneuvers in air traffic management and collision avoidance in train control."

With the goal of developing a theoretical and practical foundation for deductive verification of hybrid systems, we introduce a dynamic logic for hybrid programs, which is a program notation for hybrid systems. As a verification technique that is suitable for automation, we introduce a free variable proof calculus with a novel combination of real-valued free variables and Skolemisation for lifting quantifier elimination for real arithmetic to dynamic logic. The calculus is compositional, i.e., it reduces properties of hybrid programs to properties of their parts. Our main result proves that this calculus axiomatises the transition behaviour of hybrid systems completely relative to differential equations. In a case study with cooperating traffic agents of the European Train Control System, we further show that our calculus is well-suited for verifying realistic hybrid systems with parametric system dynamics."

Despite substantial advances in verification technology, complexity issues with classical decision procedures are still a major obstacle for formal verification of real-world applications, e.g., in automotive and avionic industries. To identify strengths and weaknesses, we examine state of the art symbolic techniques and implementations for the universal fragment of real-closed fields: approaches based on quantifier elimination, GrÃ¶bner Bases, and semidefinite programming for the Positivstellensatz. Within a uniform context of the verification tool KeYmaera, we compare these approaches qualitatively and quantitatively on verification benchmarks from hybrid systems, textbook algorithms, and on geometric problems. Finally, we introduce a new decision procedure combining GrÃ¶bner Bases and semidefinite programming for the real Nullstellensatz that outperforms the individual approaches on an interesting set of problems."

Unfortunately, the state space of stochastic biological models is often too large for classical Model Checking techniques. For these models, a statistical approach to Model Checking has been shown to be an effective alternative. Extending our earlier work, we present the first algorithm for performing statistical Model Checking using Bayesian Sequential Hypothesis Testing. We show that our Bayesian approach outperforms current statistical Model Checking techniques, which rely on tests from Classical (aka Frequentist) statistics, by requiring fewer system simulations. Another advantage of our approach is the ability to incorporate prior Biological knowledge about the model being verified. We demonstrate our algorithm on a variety of models from the Systems Biology literature and show that it enables faster verification than state-of-the-art techniques, even when no prior knowledge is available."

We show that formal verification of hybrid systems can scale to curved flight maneuvers required in aircraft control applications.

We formally prove the parameter constraints to be sharp by characterizing them equivalently in terms of reachability properties of the hybrid system dynamics. Using our deductive verification tool KeYmaera, we formally verify controllability, safety, liveness, and reactivity properties of the ETCS protocol that entail collision freedom. We prove that the ETCS protocol remains correct even in the presence of perturbation by disturbances in the dynamics.

    "Full Abstract": "We address the problem of model checking stochastic systems, i.e.~checking whether a stochastic system satisfies a certain temporal property with a probability greater (or smaller) than a fixed threshold. In particular, we present a novel Statistical Model Checking (SMC) approach based on Bayesian statistics. We show that our approach is feasible for hybrid systems with stochastic transitions, a generalization of Simulink/Stateflow models. Standard approaches to stochastic (discrete) systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems and quickly become infeasible with larger state spaces. Generalizations of these techniques to hybrid systems with stochastic effects are even more challenging. The SMC approach was pioneered by Younes and Simmons in the discrete and non-Bayesian case. It solves the verification problem by combining randomized sampling of system traces (which is very efficient for Simulink/Stateflow) with hypothesis testing or estimation. We believe SMC is essential for scaling up to large Stateflow/Simulink models. While the answer to the verification problem is not guaranteed to be correct, we prove that Bayesian SMC can make the probability of giving a wrong answer arbitrarily small. The advantage is that answers can usually be obtained much faster than with standard, exhaustive model checking techniques. We apply our Bayesian SMC approach to a representative example of stochastic discrete-time hybrid system models in Stateflow/Simulink: a fuel control system featuring hybrid behavior and fault tolerance. We show that our technique enables faster verification than state-of-the-art statistical techniques, while retaining the same error bounds. We emphasize that Bayesian SMC is by no means restricted to Stateflow/Simulink models: we have in fact successfully applied it to very large stochastic models from Systems Biology."

While each car optimizes its navigation planning locally to ensure the driver reaches his destination, all cars coordinate their actions in a distributed way in order to minimize the risk of safety hazards and collisions. These systems control the physical aspects of car movement using cyber technologies like local and remote sensor data and distributed V2V and V2I communication. They are thus cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we consider a distributed car control system that is inspired by the ambitions of the California PATH project, the CICAS system, SAFESPOT and PReVENT initiatives.We develop a formal model of a distributed car control system in which every car is controlled by adaptive cruise control. One of the major technical difficulties is that faithful models of distributed car control have both distributed systems and hybrid systems dynamics. They form distributed hybrid systems, which makes them very challenging for verification. In a formal proof system, we verify that the control model satisfies its main safety objective and guarantees collision freedom for arbitrarily many cars driving on a street, even if new cars enter the lane from on-ramps or multi-lane streets. The system we present is in many ways one of the most complicated cyber-physical systems that has ever been fully verified formally."

Nevertheless it is not widely deployed due to the overhead of existing protocols. In this paper we propose a new protocol called \"Summary Cache\"; each proxy keeps a summary of the URLs of cached documents of each participating proxy and checks these summaries for potential hits before sending any queries. Two factors contribute to the low overhead: the summaries are updated only periodically, and the summary representations are economical --- as low as 8 bits per entry. Using trace-driven simulations and a prototype implementation, we show that compared to the existing Internet Cache Protocol (ICP), Summary Cache reduces the number of inter-cache messages by a factor of 25 to 60, reduces the bandwidth consumption by over 50%, and eliminates between 30% to 95% of the CPU overhead, while at the same time maintaining almost the same hit ratio as ICP. Hence Summary Cache enables cache sharing among a large number of proxies."

Currently, most Internet applications have to be built on top of raw communication services, such as TCP connections. All additional services, including those for naming, replication, migration, persistence, fault tolerance, and security, have to be implemented for each application anew. Not only is this a waste of effort, it also makes interoperability between different applications difficult or even impossible. The authors present a novel, object-based framework for developing wide-area distributed applications. The framework is based on the concept of a distributed shared object, which has the characteristic feature that its state can be physically distributed across multiple machines at the same time. All implementation aspects, including communication protocols, replication strategies, and distribution and migration of state, are part of each object and are hidden behind its interface. The current performance problems of the World-Wide Web are taken as an example to illustrate the benefit of encapsulating state, operations, and implementation strategies on a per-object basis. The authors describe how distributed objects can be used to implement worldwide scalable Web documents."

We present an alternative view of distributed objects, in which objects are not only in control of the functional aspects of their implementation but also in control of their nonfunctional aspects, in particular, the distribution and replication of their state. We claim that a middleware platform based on this view of distributed objects is better suited for developing the large-scale applications of the future."

    "Full Abstract": "Replicating Web documents reduces user-perceived delays and wide-area network traffic. Numerous caching and replication protocols have been proposed to manage such replication while keeping the document copies consistent. We claim, however, that no single caching or replication policy can efficiently manage all documents. Instead, we propose that each document be replicated with a policy specifically tailored to it. We have collected traces on our university's Web server and conducted simulations to determine the performance such tailored policies would produce, as opposed to using the same policy for all documents. The results show a significant performance improvement with respect to end-user delays, wide-area network traffic and document consistency. We also present how these results can be used to build adaptive replicated Web documents, capable of automatically selecting the policy that best suits them."

However, URLs pose a significant scalability problem because they cannot be used to refer to replicated Web pages. The authors propose a new URI scheme called Human-Friendly Names (HFNs) to solve this scalability problem. HFNs are high-level names that are easy-to-use by humans and name Web resources in a location-independent way. This article describes a scalable HFN-to-URL resolution mechanism that is based on URNs and makes use of the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Globe Location Service."

The GDN takes a novel, optimistic approach to stop the illegal distribution of copyrighted and illicit material via the network. Instead of having moderators check the software archives at upload time, illegal content is removed and its uploader's access to the network permanently revoked only when the content is discovered. An important feature of the GDN is that the objects containing the software can run on untrustworthy servers. A first version of the GDN has been implemented and has been running since October 2000 across four European sites."

Numerous strategies for placing and maintaining multiple copies of Web documents at several sites have been proposed. These approaches essentially apply a global strategy by which a single family of protocols is used to choose replication sites and keep copies mutually consistent. We propose a more flexible approach by allowing each distributed document to have its own associated strategy. We propose a method for assigning an optimal strategy to each document separately and prove that it generates a family of optimal results. Using trace-based simulations, we show that optimal assignments clearly outperform any global strategy. We have designed an architecture for supporting documents that can dynamically select their optimal strategy and evaluate its feasibility."

This logic uses typed combinators, and we give a more or less direct translation into typed Î»-calculus, which is an easier formalism to use, though not so easy for the metatheory because of the presence of bound variables. We then describe, by example only, a proof-checker program which has been implemented for this logic; the program is fully described in [2]. We relate the induction rule which is central to the logic to two more familiar rules - Recursion Induction and Structural Induction - showing that the former is a theorem of the logic, and that for recursively defined structures the latter is a derived rule of the logic. Finally we show how the syntax and semantics of a simple programming language may be described completely in the logic, and we give an example of a theorem which relates syntactic and semantic properties of programs and which can be stated and proved within the logic."

    "Full Abstract": "The range allocation problem was recently introduced as part of an efficient decision procedure for deciding satisfiability of equivalence logic formulas with or without uninterpreted functions. These type of formulas are mainly used when proving equivalence or refinement between systems (hardware designs, compiler's translation, etc). The problem is to find in polynomial time a small finite domain for each of the variables in an equality formula Ï, such that Ï is valid if and only if it is valid over this small domain. The heuristic that was presented for finding small domains was static, i.e. it finds a small set of integer constants for each variable. In this paper we show new, more flexible range allocation methods. We also show the limitations of these and other related approaches by proving a lower bound on the size of the state space generated by such procedures. To prove this lower bound we reduce the question to a graph theoretic counting question, which we believe to be of independent interest."

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/646542.696212",
    "Full Abstract": "Parameterized systems are systems that involve numerous instantiations of the same finite-state module. Examples of parameterized systems include tele-communication protocols, bus protocols, cache coherence protocols, and many other protocols that underly current state-of-the-art systems. Formal verification of parameterized systems is known to be undecidable [AK86] and thus cannot be automated. Recent research has shown that in many cases it is possible to use abstraction methods to generate a finite-state systems from a parameterized systems. The finite-state system can then be model-checked. If successful, it is possible to conclude that the original parameterized system satisfies its requirements. Otherwise, it is often the case that the counterexample produced by the model checker can indicate an error in the original parameterized system. This combined technique allows for automatic verification of parameterized systems.This presentation describes our recent approaches that combine abstraction and model-checking to verify safety as well we liveness properties of parameterized systems. We start with the method of invisible invariants [APR+01] that combines a small-model theorem with an heuristics to generate proofs of correctness of parameterized systems. We also describe the method of network invariants [ZPK02, KPSZ02] which allows to explicitly describe a finite-system that, in a precise sense, has the same external behavior as an infinite-state one, and can be used for model-checking properties."

The proposed approach replaces P-validity with validity over a non-probabilistic version of the system, in which probabilistic choices are replaced by non-deterministic choices constrained by compassion (strong fairness) requirements. \"Simple\" properties are temporal properties whose only temporal operators are l (eventually) and its dual (always). In general, the appropriate compassion requirements are \"global,\" since they involve global states of the system. Yet, in many cases they can be transformed into \"local\" requirements, which enables their verification by model checkers. We demonstrate our methodology of translating the problem of P-validity into that of verification of a system with local compassion requirement on the \"courteous philosophers\" algorithm of [LR81], a parameterized probabilistic system that is notoriously difficult to verify, and outline a verification of the algorithm that was obtained by the tlv model checker."

    "Full Abstract": "The paper deals with the proof method of verification by finitary abstraction (VFA), which presents a feasible approach to the verification of the temporal properties of (potentially infinite-state) reactive systems. The method consists of a two-step process by which, in a first step, the system and its temporal specification are jointly abstracted into a finite-state system and a finite-state specification. The second step uses model checking to establish the validity of the abstracted property over the abstracted system. The VFA method can be considered a viable alternative to verification by temporal deduction which, up to now, has been the main method generally applicable for verification of infinite-state systems. The paper presents a general recipe for the joint abstraction, which is shown to be sound, where soundness means that validity over the abstract system implies validity over the concrete (original) system. To make the method applicable for the verification of liveness properties, pure abstraction is sometimes no longer adequate. We show that by augmenting the system by an appropriate (and standardly constructible) progress monitor, we obtain an augmented system, whose computations are essentially the same as the original system, and which may now be abstracted while preserving the desired liveness properties. We refer to the extended method as verification by augmented abstraction (VAA). We then proceed to show that the VAA method is sound and complete for proving all properties expressible by temporal logic (including both safety and liveness). Completeness establishes that whenever the property is valid, there exists a finitary abstraction which abstracts the system, augmented by an appropriate progress monitor, into a finite-state system which validated the abstracted property.

    "Full Abstract": "Enabled by RISC technologies, low-cost commodity microprocessors are performing at ever increasing levels, significantly via instruction level parallelism (ILP). This in turn increases the opportunities for their use in a variety of day-to-day applications ranging from the simple control of appliances such as microwave ovens, to sophisticated systems for cabin control in modern aircraft. Indeed, embedded applications such as these represent segments in the computer industry with great potential for growth. However, this growth is currently impeded by the lack of robust optimizing compiler technologies that support the assured, rapid and inexpensive prototyping of real-time software in the context of microprocessors with ILP. In this paper we describe a novel notation, TimeC, for specifying timing constraints in programs, i&gt;independent of the base language being used to develop the embedded application; TimeC specifications are language independent and can be instrumented into imperative and object-oriented languages non-intrusively. As we will show, the program synthesis problem that arise out of Time_tract specifications, a subset of TimeC, are always tractable. In contrast, a range of specification mechanisms proposed earlier yield substantially intractable synthesis questions, thereby limiting their potential utility. We will compare the tractability and related expressive power issues between TimeC and some of the extant mechanisms for specifying properties of timed programs."

    "Full Abstract": "From the first introduction of the notion of \"Reactive Systems\" and development of specification languages (such as Temporal Logic and Statecharts) and verification methods for this class of systems, it has been stated that this notion encompasses a wider class of systems than just programs or hardware designs, and should be applicable to other complex systems unrelated to computers. In a similar vein, the acronym UML talks about \"modeling language\" rather than \"programming language\", implying that the approach should be applicable to a more general class of systems than just computer-related.While this claim of wider applicability has been always implied, it was never before seriously substantiated. In this talk, I will describe some recent attempts to apply the discipline of formal methods to the modeling, analysis, and prediction of biological systems. This corresponds to an emerging trend in Biology, according to which Biology in the 21st century will have to direct its attention towards understanding how component parts collaborate to create a whole system or organism. The transition from identifying building blocks (analysis) to integrating the parts into a whole (synthesis) will have to use mathematics and algorithmics. We need a language that is legible both to biologists and computers, and that is faithful to the logic of the biological system of interest.In search for an appropriate rigorous approach to modeling biological systems, we examined formal modeling methods in computer science that were originally developed for specification, design, and analysis of reactive systems. We found that the visual formalism of statecharts can address this challenge, within the general framework of object-oriented modeling. This conclusion followed an initial study we carried out, in which we constructed a detailed executable model for T cell activation, and were able, using verification techniques to find and correct a flaw in the original model.Following this preliminary study, we have now undertaken the more challenging project of applying and extending this methodology for constructing a detailed model of the developmental processes that lead to the formation of the egg-laying system in the nematode C. elegans. The model is built to capture in a natural yet rigorous and analyzable way the aspects of concurrency, multi scalar data, and hierarchical organization. This project involves a close collaboration with Naaman Kam, David Harel, and Irun Cohen from the department of Immunology at the Weizmann Institute."

    "Full Abstract": "Object matching is a fundamental problem that arises in numerous information integration scenarios. Virtually all existing solutions assume that the objects to be matched share the same attribute set and that systems can match them by comparing attribute similarities. Our work addresses the more general problem in which objects also have disjoint attributes-for example, matching tuples from relational tables that have different schemas, such as (age, name) and (name, salary). Profile-Based Object Matching, which applies this idea, exploits disjoint attributes to improve matching accuracy. PROM first matches any two tuples based on a shared attribute, such as name. It then applies a set of profilers, each of which contains some knowledge about what constitutes a typical person. The profilers examine the tuple pair to see if it plausibly describes a person. A profiler might state, for example, that if the pair produces a person with an age of 6 and a salary of $100,000, the pair doesn't describe a real person, so the tuples don't match. Profilers can be manually specified by domain experts, trained on training data, transferred from other matching tasks, or built from external data. PROM is thus distinct in that it not only exploits disjoint attributes to improve matching accuracy but also facilitates knowledge reuse from previous object-matching tasks."

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1007568.1007582",
    "Full Abstract": "An increasing number of data sources now become available on the Web, but often their contents are only accessible through query interfaces. For a domain of interest, there often exist many such sources with varied coverage or querying capabilities. As an important step to the integration of these sources, we consider the integration of their query interfaces. More specifically, we focus on the crucial step of the integration: accurately matching the interfaces. While the integration of query interfaces has received more attentions recently, current approaches are not sufficiently general: (a) they all model interfaces with flat schemas; (b) most of them only consider 1:1 mappings of fields over the interfaces; (c) they all perform the integration in a blackbox-like fashion and the whole process has to be restarted from scratch if anything goes wrong; and (d) they often require laborious parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose an interactive, clustering-based approach to matching query interfaces. The hierarchical nature of interfaces is captured with ordered trees. Varied types of complex mappings of fields are examined and several approaches are proposed to effectively identify these mappings. We put the human integrator back in the loop and propose several novel approaches to the interactive learning of parameters and the resolution of uncertain mappings. Extensive experiments are conducted and results show that our approach is highly effective."

    "Full Abstract": "Schema Matching is the problem of identifying corresponding elements in different schemas. Discovering these correspondences or matches is inherently difficult to automate. Past solutions have proposed a principled combination of multiple algorithms. However, these solutions sometimes perform rather poorly due to the lack ofsufficient evidence in the schemas being matched. In this paper we show how a corpus of schemas and mappings can be used to augment the evidence about the schemas being matched, so they can be matched better. Such a corpus typically contains multiple schemas that model similar concepts and hence enables us to learn variations in the elements and their properties. We exploit such a corpus in two ways. First, we increase the evidence about each element being matched by including evidence from similar elements in the corpus. Second, we learn statistics about elements and their relationships and use them to infer constraints that we use to prune candidate mappings. We also describe how to use known mappings to learn the importance of domain and generic constraints. We present experimental results that demonstrate corpus-based matching outperforms direct matching (without the benefit of a corpus) in multiple domains."

Numerous solutions have been developed, but they have not considered in depth the problem of exploiting integrity constraints that frequently exist in the domains. Examples of such constraints include \"a mention with age two cannot match a mention with salary 200K\" and \"if two paper citations match, then their authors are likely to match in the same order\". In this paper we describe a probabilistic solution to entity matching that exploits such constraints to improve matching accuracy. At the heart of the solution is a generative model that takes into account the constraints during the generation process, and provides well-defined interpretations of the constraints. We describe a novel combination of EM and relaxation labeling algorithms that efficiently learns the model, thereby matching mentions in an unsupervised way, without the need for annotated training data. Experiments on several real-world domains show that our solution can exploit constraints to significantly improve matching accuracy, by 3-12% F-1, and that the solution scales up to large data sets."

Given a set of sources in a domain of interest, DeepMiner first learns a base ontology from their query interfaces. It then grows the current ontology by probing the sources and discovering additional concepts and instances from the data pages retrieved from the sources. We have evaluated DeepMiner in several real-world domains. Preliminary results indicate that DeepMiner discovers concepts and instances with high accuracy."

Since the optimization problem can be shown to be NP-complete, we develop a novel approximation algorithm LMax, which builds the unified schema via recursive applications of clustering aggregation. We further extend LMax to handle the irregularities frequently occurring among the interface schemas. Extensive evaluation on real-world data sets shows the effectiveness of our approach."

Discrete probabilistic systems have been studied using logic. But logic has been chronically underdeveloped in the context of stochastic hybrid systems, i.e., systems with interacting discrete, continuous, and stochastic dynamics. We aim at overcoming this deficiency and introduce a dynamic logic for stochastic hybrid systems. Our results indicate that logic is a promising tool for understanding stochastic hybrid systems and can help taming some of their complexity. We introduce a compositional model for stochastic hybrid systems. We prove adaptivity, cÃ dlÃ g, and Markov time properties, and prove that the semantics of our logic is measurable.

In this paper, we argue that a good model for the Smart Grid must match its basic properties: it must be hybrid (both evolve over time, and perform control/computation), distributed (multiple concurrently executing entities), and allow for asynchronous communication and stochastic behaviour (to accurately model real-world power consumption). We propose Distributed Probabilistic-Control Hybrid Automata (DPCHA) as a model for this purpose, and extend Bounded LTL to Quantified Bounded LTL in order to adapt and apply existing statistical model-checking techniques. We provide an implementation of a framework for developing and verifying DPCHAs. Finally, we conduct a case study for Smart Grid communications analysis."

    "Full Abstract": "Distributed hybrid systems present extraordinarily challenging problems for verification. On top of the notorious difficulties associated with distributed systems, they also exhibit continuous dynamics described by quantified differential equations. All serious proofs rely on decision procedures for real arithmetic, which can be extremely expensive. Quantified Differential Dynamic Logic (QdL) has been identified as a promising approach for getting a handle in this domain. QdL has been proved to be complete relative to quantified differential equations. But important questions remain as to how best to translate this theoretical result into practice: how do we succinctly specify a proof search strategy, and how do we control the computational cost? We address the problem of automated theorem proving for distributed hybrid systems. We identify a simple mode of use of QdL that cuts down on the enormous number of choices that it otherwise allows during proof search. We have designed a powerful strategy and tactics language for directing proof search. With these techniques, we have implemented a new automated theorem prover called KeYmaeraD. To overcome the high computational complexity of distributed hybrid systems verification, KeYmaeraD uses a distributed proving backend. We have experimentally observed that calls to the real arithmetic decision procedure can effectively be made in parallel. In this paper, we demonstrate these findings through an extended case study where we prove absence of collisions in a distributed car control system with a varying number of arbitrarily many cars."

In discrete dynamical systems, the state evolves in discrete steps, one step at a time, as described by a difference equation or discrete state transition relation. In continuous dynamical systems, the state evolves continuously along a function, typically described by a differential equation. Hybrid dynamical systems or hybrid systems combine both discrete and continuous dynamics. This is a brief survey of differential dynamic logic for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid systems. We explain hybrid system models, differential dynamic logic, its semantics, and its axiomatization for proving logical formulas about hybrid systems. We study differential invariants, i.e., induction principles for differential equations. We briefly survey theoretical results, including soundness and completeness and deductive power. Differential dynamic logic has been implemented in automatic and interactive theorem provers and has been used successfully to verify safety-critical applications in automotive, aviation, railway, robotics, and analogue electrical circuits."

We now show that, proof-theoretically, this is not the case. We present a complete proof-theoretical alignment that interreduces the discrete dynamics and the continuous dynamics of hybrid systems. We give a sound and complete axiomatization of hybrid systems relative to continuous dynamical systems and a sound and complete axiomatization of hybrid systems relative to discrete dynamical systems. Thanks to our axiomatization, proving properties of hybrid systems is exactly the same as proving properties of continuous dynamical systems and again, exactly the same as proving properties of discrete dynamical systems. This fundamental cornerstone sheds light on the nature of hybridness and enables flexible and provably perfect combinations of discrete reasoning with continuous reasoning that lift to all aspects of hybrid systems and their fragments."

One well identified shortcoming of SMC is that, unlike probabilistic model checking, it cannot be applied to systems featuring nondeterminism, such as Markov Decision Processes (MDP). We address this limitation by developing an algorithm that resolves nondeterminism probabilistically, and then uses multiple rounds of sampling and Reinforcement Learning to provably improve resolutions of nondeterminism with respect to satisfying a Bounded Linear Temporal Logic (BLTL) property. Our algorithm thus reduces an MDP to a fully probabilistic Markov chain on which SMC may be applied to give an approximate solution to the problem of checking the probabilistic BLTL property. We integrate our algorithm in a parallelised modification of the PRISM simulation framework. Extensive validation with both new and PRISM benchmarks demonstrates that the approach scales very well in scenarios where symbolic algorithms fail to do so."

These safety-critical systems must be extremely reliable, and as such, many resources are invested into ensuring that the protocols they implement are accurate. Still, it is challenging to guarantee that such a controller works properly under every circumstance. In tough scenarios where a large number of aircraft must execute a collision avoidance maneuver, a human pilot under stress is not necessarily able to understand the complexity of the distributed system and may not take the right course, especially if actions must be taken quickly. We consider a class of distributed collision avoidance controllers designed to work even in environments with arbitrarily many aircraft or UAVs. We prove that the controllers never allow the aircraft to get too close to one another, even when new planes approach an in-progress avoidance maneuver that the new plane may not be aware of. Because these safety guarantees always hold, the aircraft are protected against unexpected emergent behavior which simulation and testing may miss. This is an important step in formally verified, flyable, and distributed air traffic control."

    "Full Abstract": "We address the problem of model checking stochastic systems, i.e., checking whether a stochastic system satisfies a certain temporal property with a probability greater (or smaller) than a fixed threshold. In particular, we present a Statistical Model Checking (SMC) approach based on Bayesian statistics. We show that our approach is feasible for a certain class of hybrid systems with stochastic transitions, a generalization of Simulink/Stateflow models. Standard approaches to stochastic discrete systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems and quickly become infeasible with larger state spaces. Generalizations of these techniques to hybrid systems with stochastic effects are even more challenging. The SMC approach was pioneered by Younes and Simmons in the discrete and non-Bayesian case. It solves the verification problem by combining randomized sampling of system traces (which is very efficient for Simulink/Stateflow) with hypothesis testing (i.e., testing against a probability threshold) or estimation (i.e., computing with high probability a value close to the true probability). We believe SMC is essential for scaling up to large Stateflow/Simulink models. While the answer to the verification problem is not guaranteed to be correct, we prove that Bayesian SMC can make the probability of giving a wrong answer arbitrarily small. The advantage is that answers can usually be obtained much faster than with standard, exhaustive model checking techniques. We apply our Bayesian SMC approach to a representative example of stochastic discrete-time hybrid system models in Stateflow/Simulink: a fuel control system featuring hybrid behavior and fault tolerance. We show that our technique enables faster verification than state-of-the-art statistical techniques. We emphasize that Bayesian SMC is by no means restricted to Stateflow/Simulink models. It is in principle applicable to a variety of stochastic models from other domains, e.g., systems biology."

Applications can be found in consumer robotics, in road, rail, and air transportation, manufacturing, and military operations. Unfortunately, the approaches to modeling and analyzing the behavior of dynamic spatial systems are just as diverse as these application domains. In this article, we discuss reasoning approaches for the medium-term control of autonomous agents in dynamic spatial systems, which requires a sufficiently detailed description of the agentâs behavior and environment but may still be conducted in a qualitative manner. We survey logic-based qualitative and hybrid modeling and commonsense reasoning approaches with respect to their features for describing and analyzing dynamic spatial systems in general, and the actions of autonomous agents operating therein in particular. We introduce a conceptual reference model, which summarizes the current understanding of the characteristics of dynamic spatial systems based on a catalog of evaluation criteria derived from the model. We assess the modeling features provided by logic-based qualitative commonsense and hybrid approaches for projection, planning, simulation, and verification of dynamic spatial systems. We provide a comparative summary of the modeling features, discuss lessons learned, and introduce a research roadmap for integrating different approaches of dynamic spatial system analysis to achieve coverage of all required features."

But the need behind a web search is often not informational -- it might be navigational (give me the url of the site I want to reach) or transactional (show me sites where I can perform a certain transaction, e.g. shop, download a file, or find a map).

    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/775152.775247",
    "Full Abstract": "Crawling the web is deceptively simple: the basic algorithm is (a) Fetch a page (b) Parse it to extract all linked URLs (c) For all the URLs not seen before, repeat (a)-(c). However, the size of the web (estimated at over 4 billion pages) and its rate of change (estimated at 7% per week) move this plan from a trivial programming exercise to a serious algorithmic and system design challenge. Indeed, these two factors alone imply that for a reasonably fresh and complete crawl of the web, step (a) must be executed about a thousand times per second, and thus the membership test (c) must be done well over ten thousand times per second against a set too large to store in main memory. This requires a distributed architecture, which further complicates the membership test.A crucial way to speed up the test is to cache, that is, to store in main memory a (dynamic) subset of the \"seen\" URLs. The main goal of this paper is to carefully investigate several URL caching techniques for web crawling. We consider both practical algorithms: random replacement, static cache, LRU, and CLOCK, and theoretical limits: clairvoyant caching and infinite cache. We performed about 1,800 simulations using these algorithms with various cache sizes, using actual log data extracted from a massive 33 day web crawl that issued over one billion HTTP requests.Our main conclusion is that caching is very effective - in our setup, a cache of roughly 50,000 entries can achieve a hit rate of almost 80%. Interestingly, this cache size falls at a critical point: a substantially smaller cache is much less effective while a substantially larger cache brings little additional benefit. We conjecture that such critical points are inherent to our problem and venture an explanation for this phenomenon."

    "Full Abstract": "A cornerstone concept in classical Information Retrieval is the vector space model, whereby both documents and queries are viewed as vectors in a multidimensional space. Relevance of a given document to a given query is determined by evaluating the similarity between these vectors, using a measure like the cosine measure of similarity, for instance. The vector space model has been highly successful for dealing with plain text collections, in both theoretical and practical terms. In prior work, we extended this classic approach to the search of XML collections by requiring queries to be presented as XML Fragments, which allows for a very simple extension of the cosine similarity measure to the XML framework."

With the advent of content delivery networks, it is becoming more and more frequent that data content is placed on hosts that are not directly controlled by the content owner, and because of this, security mechanisms to protect data integrity are necessary. In this paper we present a system architecture that allows arbitrary queries to be supported on data content replicated on untrusted servers. To prevent these servers from returning erroneous answers to client queries, we make use of a small number of trusted hosts that randomly check these answers and take corrective action whenever necessary. Additionally, our system employs an audit mechanism that guarantees that any untrusted server acting maliciously will eventually be detected and excluded from the system."

    "Full Abstract": "Digital rights management systems allow copyrighted content to be commercialized in digital format without the risk of revenue loss due to piracy. Making such systems secure is no easy task, given that content needs to be protected while accessed through electronic devices in the hands of potentially malicious end-users; in this context, intrusion tolerance becomes a very useful system property. In this paper we point out a limitation shared by all current DRM architectures, namely their weakness in reacting to possible device compromise and confining the damage caused by such a compromise. As a solution, we propose a paradigm shift - moving from the original DRM system model where all devices are equally trustworthy and have discretionary control over all protected content, to a new model where information flow is controlled through a multi-level security policy that differentiates between devices based on their tamper-resistance properties. We show that besides improved intrusion-tolerance, supporting such policies has other advantages, such as the ability to define more flexible business models for supplying content. We also show that for a given DRM architecture, the type authentication protocol used when accepting new devices in the system has a big impact on how well multi-level security policies can be supported, and that a number of protocols currently being considered are not very well suited for this job."

Alternatively, several authors have proposed trust metrics to evaluate the confidence afforded by a public key. However their work has a static point of view and does not take into account the issue of public key revocation. In this paper, we make the first attempt to incorporate the revocation status information into the trust metrics for public key certification. To achieve our goal, we use a tailored form of a vector of trust model recently proposed. This would allow us to reason formally about when there is a need to check revocation status and how reliable the revocation mechanism should be in a given security application."

For example, they will allow smart washing machines to check for incompatible clothes (e.g., white shirts and red socks) and smart refrigerators to check for milk that is too old to be consumed. Subdermal tags with medical information are already being implanted in animals and people. However, a world in which practically everything is tagged and can be read at a modest distance by anyone who wants to buy an RFID reader introduces serious security and privacy issues. For example, women walking down the street may be effectively broadcasting the sizes of their RFID-tagged bras and medical data without realizing it. To protect people in this environment, we propose developing a compact, portable, electronic device called an RFID Guardian, which people can carry with them. In the future, it could be integrated into PDAs or cell phones. The RFID Guardian looks for, records, and displays all RFID tags and scans in the vicinity, manages RFID keys, authenticates nearby RFID readers, and blocks attempted accesses to the userâs RFID tags from unauthorized readers. In this way, people can find out what RFID activity is occuring around them and take corrective action if need be."

In this paper we focus on one of this primitive, namely security credentials. We present a solution that extends the existing protocols used to implement off-line credentials such that, not only abuses can be detected but they can also be counted. Our solution addresses the problem of 1-time and 2-times credentials and we will conclude by discussing the challenges that need to be solved to generalize the primitive to"

By utilizing the low-cost property of sensor nodes, we introduce the novel concept of one-time sensors to mitigate node-capture attacks. The basic idea is to load each sensor with only one cryptographic token so that the captured node can inject only a single malicious message into the network. In addition, sybil attacks are avoided and explicit revocation is not necessary using one-time sensors. By using public key techniques, one-way hash functions and Merkleâs hash tree, we also show efficient implementations and interesting tradeoffs for one-time sensors."

We show that, in general, graphs with two colors have exponential expected cover time, and graphs with three or more colors have doublyâexponential expected cover time. We also give polynomial bounds on the expected cover time in a number of interesting special cases.

We have implemented our algorithms as part of the Play-Engine tool and the generated statechart model can then be executed using existing UML case tools."

    "Full Abstract": "Parameterized systems are systems that involve numerous instantiations of the same finite-state module, and depend on a parameter which defines their size. Examples of parameterized systems include sensor systems, telecommunication protocols, bus protocols, cache coherence protocols, and many other protocols that underly current state-of-the-art systems. Formal verification of parameterized systems is known to be undecidable (Inform. Process. Lett. 22 (6)) and thus cannot be automated. Recent research has shown that it is often the case that a combination of methodologies allows to reduce the problem of verification of a parameterized system into the problem of verification of a finite-state system, that can be automatically verified. This paper describes several recent methodologies, based on model checking and abstraction. We start with the method of invisible auxiliary assertions that combines a small-model theorem with heuristics to automatically generate auxiliary constructs used in proofs of correctness of parameterized systems. We also describe the method of counter abstraction that offers simple liveness proofs for many parameterized systems, and discuss novel methodologies of using counter abstraction to automatically verify that probabilistic parameterized system satisfy their temporal specifications with probability 1."

The extensions cover two key features of the rich version of LSCs, namely, time and forbidden elements. The former is crucial for systems with time constraints and/or time-driven behavior, and the latter allows specifying invariants and contracts on behavior. Forbidden elements can also help reduce the state space considered, thus enabling smart play-out to handle larger models."

    "Full Abstract": "We define a subset krtUML of UML which is rich enough to express such modelling entities of UML, used in real-time applications, as active objects, dynamic object creation and destruction, dynamically changing communication topologies, combinations of synchronous and asynchronous communication, and shared memory usage through object attributes. We define a formal interleaving semantics for this kernel language by associating with each model"

    "Full Abstract": "We provide semantics for the powerful scenario-based language of live sequence charts (LSCs). We show how the semantics of live sequence charts can be captured using temporal logic. This is done by studying various subsets of the LSC language and providing an explicit translation into temporal logic. We show how a kernel subset of the LSC language (which omits variables, for example) can be embedded within the temporal logic CTL"

    "Title": "Matching Schemas in Online Communities",
    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497419",
    "Full Abstract": "When integrating data from multiple sources, a key task that online communities often face is to match the schemas of the data sources. Today, such matching often incurs a huge workload that overwhelms the relatively small set of volunteer integrators. In such cases, community members may not even volunteer to be integrators, due to the high workload, and consequently no integration systems can be built. To address this problem, we propose to enlist the multitude of users in the community to help match the schemas, in a Web 2.0 fashion. We discuss the challenges of this approach and provide initial solutions. Finally, we describe an extensive set of experiments on both real-world and synthetic data that demonstrate the utility of the approach."

    "Title": "Optimizing SQL Queries over Text Databases",
    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497472",
    "Full Abstract": "Text documents often embed data that is structured in nature, and we can expose this structured data using information extraction technology. By processing a text database with information extraction systems, we can materialize a variety of structured \"relations,\" over which we can then issue regular SQL queries. A key challenge to process SQL queries in this text-based scenario is efficiency: information extraction is time-consuming, so query processing strategies should minimize the number of documents that they process. Another key challenge is result quality: in the traditional relational world, all correct execution strategies for a SQL query produce the same (correct) result; in contrast, a SQL query execution over a text database might produce answers that are not fully accurate or complete, for a number of reasons. To address these challenges, we study a family of select-project-join SQL queries over text databases, and characterize query processing strategies on their efficiency and - critically - on their result quality as well. We optimize the execution of SQL queries over text databases in a principled, cost-based manner, incorporating this tradeoff between efficiency and result quality in a user-specific fashion. Our large-scale experiments- over real data sets and multiple information extraction systems - show that our SQL query processing approach consistently picks appropriate execution strategies for the desired balance between efficiency and result quality."

    "Title": "Building Community Wikipedias",
    "URL": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497473",
    "Full Abstract": "The rapid growth of Web communities has motivated many solutions for building community data portals. These solutions follow roughly two approaches. The first approach (e.g., Libra, Citeseer, Cimple) employs semi-automatic methods to extract and integrate data from a multitude of data sources. The second approach (e.g., Wikipedia, Intellipedia) deploys an initial portal in wiki format, then invites community members to revise and add material. In this paper we consider combining the above two approaches to building community portals. The new hybrid machine-human approach brings significant benefits. It can achieve broader and deeper coverage, provide more incentives for users to contribute, and keep the portal more up-to-date with less user effort. In a sense, it enables building \"community wikipedias\", backed by an underlying structured database that is continuously updated using automatic techniques. We outline our ideas for the new approach, describe its challenges and opportunities, and provide initial solutions. Finally, we describe a real-world implementation and preliminary experiments that demonstrate the utility of the new approach."
